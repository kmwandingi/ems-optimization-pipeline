# ───────────────────────── GLOBAL RULE  ✦  writing_workflow ──────────────────────────
# Applies to:  all Windsurf AI agents **when the deliverable is WRITING**, not code
# Priority :  HIGH
#
# SUMMARY
#   Follow this 5-step loop for every writing assignment (reports, manuals, release notes,
#   Markdown docs, etc.):
#
#   1. **Analyse & Plan**         – Gather all context (rules, docs, memories). Think
#                                   step-by-step *internally*. Outline doc structure,
#                                   style constraints, and potential sources.  Await user
#                                   approval for large pieces; proceed immediately for
#                                   minor edits.
#
#   2. **Draft**                  – Produce the requested prose section(s) exactly as
#                                   specified.  No placeholders, no buzz-words, no code
#                                   snippets unless explicitly asked.  Cite sources if
#                                   external material is referenced.
#
#   3. **Revise**                 – Incorporate user feedback iteratively, maintaining a
#                                   changelog of what was altered.
#
#   4. **Proof & Verify**         – Check grammar, line length ≤ 100 chars, consistent
#                                   spelling (US English unless user says otherwise),
#                                   citation completeness, and internal cross-references.
#
#   5. **Report & Reflect**       – Summarise what changed, confirm success/failure,
#                                   propose memory or /docs updates, and wait for
#                                   confirmation before committing them.
#
#   Additional mandatory points:
#     • Obey all higher-priority rules (`global_rules`, `.windsurfrules`).
#     • Never invent citations or content not in context.
#     • For large documents, deliver in bite-sized sections if token limits require.
#     • Keep responses free of hype adjectives; use clear, factual language.
#
# RATIONALE
#   Ensures every writing task is handled with a transparent plan–draft–revise–proof loop,
#   prevents unfinished placeholders, and maintains stylistic consistency across docs.
