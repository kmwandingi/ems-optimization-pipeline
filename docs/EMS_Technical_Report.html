    <h1>EMS Technical Report</h1>
    <h1>Smart Building Energy Optimization: A Probabilistic, Multi-Agent MILP Framework</h1>
<h2>0. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Rising energy prices and the growing number of controllable devices make it difficult for building operators or occupants to decide when to run appliances, charge batteries or use solar power in the most cost-effective way. This report describes an Energy Management System (EMS) developed and tested on six buildings over several weeks, which learns from historical device usage and price signals to plan operations each day. The system observes when appliances are actually used and records relevant data (such as hourly electricity prices, weather forecasts for solar output, and battery requirements) to build simple prediction models for both whether a device will be used on a given day and when during the day it is likely to run. These models form the basis for daily planning.</p>
<p>To forecast daily likelihoods, we trained a LightGBM model on past usage features (day of week, recent patterns, weather summaries) so the system estimates how likely each device is to be needed on each day. For hours within a day, we used CatBoost to estimate a probability distribution over hours when usage could occur, drawing on time-of-day patterns, temperature or solar irradiance at each hour, and past behavior. These probability distributions are then translated into preference signals that guide the next step: finding a schedule that balances lower expected cost with respect for likely usage times.</p>
<p>The planning step employs a mixed-integer programming formulation that combines electricity price forecasts, solar generation forecasts, battery charge/discharge limits and device requirements. Probability estimates enter as “soft” guidance: the model may schedule a device at a less likely hour if cost benefits justify it, but it avoids forcing operations at times that rarely match observed habits. For key uncertainties—such as variable solar output or when an electric vehicle must be charged—the system creates multiple scenarios based on historical forecast errors and usage patterns, then chooses plans that perform well across these scenarios. This helps ensure the schedule remains practical
 even when, for example, solar production deviates from its forecast.</p>
<p>After each day, the EMS compares predicted usage against actual behavior and adjusts its probability models through a gradual update rule inspired by Bayesian ideas. This continuous feedback loop refines future predictions so that over time, schedules align more closely with real habits. All model training runs, updated probability estimates, and optimization runs are tracked with MLflow, enabling reproducibility, versioning and analysis of how changes affect performance. The system is organized around modular agents for each device type, battery and solar forecasting, allowing components to be developed and tested independently yet work together in a unified daily cycle.</p>
<p>When applied to six diverse buildings using real consumption and price data, the EMS achieved bill reductions of roughly 10–30 percent compared to leaving devices unscheduled, and it increased on-site solar self-use significantly. These outcomes held whether electricity prices varied hourly (as in parts of Europe) or remained simpler (as in emerging markets like Curaçao). By learning from actual usage, planning with awareness of uncertainties, and improving models each day, the EMS offers a practical path to lower costs, greater solar utilization and better value from battery investments. Detailed explanations of datasets, model features, planning formulation, scenario generation and system architecture appear in the main report.</p>

<h2>2. Project Context</h2>
<h3>2.1 Project Background</h3>
<p>The modern energy landscape is undergoing rapid transformation driven by increased renewable energy integration, dynamic electricity pricing, and rising consumption complexity. In smart grids—such as those emerging in the Netherlands—electricity prices fluctuate frequently, offering substantial opportunities for cost optimization through demand response and load shifting. However, many buildings lack automated energy management capabilities, leaving households and commercial users unable to fully exploit potential cost savings.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, as renewable energy sources like solar and wind become prevalent, grid stability challenges emerge due to intermittent generation patterns. This intermittency increases grid congestion risks, particularly during peak periods, and necessitates more demand-side management strategies to ensure reliability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, energy costs continue to rise globally, influenced by factors such as fossil fuel price volatility, regulatory changes, and infrastructure investments required for renewable integration. For end-users, especially households and small commercial entities, the complexity of managing multiple energy-consuming devices (e.g., electric vehicles, heating systems, washing machines, and dishwashers) further exacerbates the challenge of efficient energy use.</p>
<p>This project was initiated through Ilustre Lab—a living lab formed through collaboration between JADS (Jheronimus Academy of Data Science, a partnership between Tilburg University and TU/e), LaNubia Consulting, and ROBUST—to develop AI-driven solutions for energy management across diverse environments. Ilustre Lab plays a central role in bridging academic research with real-world applications, ensuring that the EMS project aligns with industry needs and facilitates a smooth transfer of technology to practical deployments, particularly in the Caribbean context.</p>
<p>The project employs a <strong>dual-track approach</strong>:
1. <strong>Dutch Context</strong>: Prototyped in an environment with day-ahead pricing, smart metering, and flexible demand-response capabilities
2. <strong>Curaçao Context</strong>: Designed for future adaptation to Caribbean island settings where current pricing is monthly and smart infrastructure is still developing</p>
<p>In contrast, Curaçao currently employs monthly electricity pricing, but faces distinct challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Transition</strong>: Curaçao's National Energy Policy aims for higher renewable penetration, introducing intermittent generation that requires more dynamic demand-side flexibility to ensure grid reliability</li>
<li><strong>Energy Poverty</strong>: Many households experience difficulty affording electricity, causing financial hardship and disconnections. This amplifies the importance of cost-effective energy management</li>
<li><strong>Isolated Grid System</strong>: As an island, Curaçao operates an isolated power grid that, although very stable, is more vulnerable should the grid fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining mathematical optimization with practical energy management strategies, the EMS provides solutions for:
- Reducing energy costs through intelligent load shifting
- Supporting grid stability by smoothing consumption patterns
- Integrating renewable energy sources more effectively
- Mitigating energy poverty through improved consumption management</p>
<p>Throughout the project, our strategy evolved in a series of deliberate, sequential steps that integrated rigorous data science methodologies with a holistic understanding of the energy management challenges faced at both the device level and the grid level. Key phases included problem identification and refinement, contextualization, comprehensive literature review, formulation of research questions, design of research methodology, framework selection, ethical considerations, and planning for future enhancements.</p>
<h3>2.2 Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Against the backdrop of transforming energy landscapes, our project aims to bridge the efficiency gap between current consumption patterns and the potential for flexible, optimized energy use. The central research problem is framed as:</p>
<p>"How can we design a modular EMS that leverages MILP-based scheduling to optimize household energy consumption under dynamic pricing—integrating optional DERs (PV, battery) and grid constraints—in a way that is effective in the Dutch context and readily adaptable for the evolving Curaçao market?"</p>
<p>We identified that the "energy efficiency gap"—where households consume energy inefficiently due to behavioral inertia and a lack of automated control—has received considerable attention in the literature. Several notable studies, such as Henggeler Antunes et al. (2022), Bradac et al. (2014), and Gerards et al. (2015), have developed modular and holistic MILP-based optimization frameworks that can accommodate a range of flexible and inflexible devices within residential or commercial buildings. These works have shown the feasibility and value of unified, whole-building optimization strategies—moving beyond purely device-specific or rule-based methods. However, challenges remain in areas such as real-time adaptability, seamless integration with probabilistic user behavior models, and continuous online learning from operational feedback. Our work builds on this foundation by embedding machine-learned probabilistic device usage patterns as soft constraints in the MILP, incorporating scenario-based uncertainty modeling, and implementing a closed-loop Bayesian update cycle to refine device behavior models over time.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2.4 Literature Review</h3>
<p>The development of our Energy Management System builds upon several key research areas, including home energy management systems (HEMS), probabilistic optimization under uncertainty, and machine learning for energy usage prediction. This section provides a critical analysis of relevant literature that informed our technical approach.</p>
<h4>Home Energy Management Systems</h4>
<p>The field of home energy management has evolved significantly over the past decade. Shareef et al. (2018) presented a review of HEMS technologies, highlighting the importance of integrating IoT devices with optimization algorithms to achieve effective energy management. Their work emphasized that while rule-based systems were common, they often failed to adapt to changing user behaviors and dynamic pricing environments.</p>
<p>Building on this foundation, Balakrishnan &amp; Geetha (2021) categorized HEMS implementations into rule-based, optimization-based, and hybrid approaches. Their analysis revealed that hybrid approaches combining classical optimization with learning components showed the most promise for real-world deployments. However, they noted that many systems still relied on theoretical user models rather than data-driven approaches.</p>
<p>Vrettos et al. (2013) demonstrated the value of small-scale batteries and flexible thermal loads in maximizing local PV utilization, establishing a baseline for integrating battery operations with load scheduling. Their work, however, did not account for probabilistic user behavior patterns, which we address in our approach.</p>
<p>Setlhaolo et al. (2014) specifically tackled the problem of household appliance scheduling for demand response using MILP formulations. While effective for deterministic scenarios, their approach lacked mechanisms to handle user preference uncertainty—a gap our system specifically addresses through probabilistic modeling.</p>
<h4>Probabilistic Optimization and Uncertainty Handling</h4>
<p>Among various approaches in the literature, Antunes et al. (2022) explored probabilistic and scenario-based optimization for home energy management under user behavior uncertainty. Their approach of modeling user behavior as probability distributions rather than deterministic patterns provided useful insights for our methodology. However, their system relied on pre-defined distributions rather than learning them from historical data.</p>
<p>Kanakadhurga &amp; Prabaharan (2024) presented a scenario-based robust MILP approach specifically designed for smart home energy management that integrates PV, battery, and EV under uncertainty. Their work validated the effectiveness of scenario sampling for handling uncertainty in renewable generation and demonstrated practical cost savings. Our approach extends this concept by integrating learned device usage patterns directly into the optimization framework.</p>
<p>Li et al. (2024) explored data-driven approaches for battery management in residential energy systems, comparing model predictive control with reinforcement learning methods. Their work validated the importance of adaptability in battery management strategies, which we incorporate into our battery agent implementation.</p>
<h4>Machine Learning for Energy Prediction and Optimization</h4>
<p>Recent advancements in applying machine learning to energy forecasting have shown promising results. Neumann &amp; Hahn (2024) demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for short-term energy forecasting in smart homes. While their work focused on aggregate consumption forecasting, we extend similar concepts to device-level usage prediction.</p>
<p>Zafar et al. (2023) provided a review of reinforcement learning methods for household energy management, highlighting the importance of continuous learning and adaptation. Their analysis of various RL approaches informed our continuous learning pipeline design, although we opted for a more interpretable gradient-boosted tree approach rather than deep reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Wei et al. (2020) presented a MILP-based optimal power management system for residential buildings with plug-in electric vehicles. Their mathematical formulation for EV charging optimization served as a reference for our partial-usage device model, though we simplified certain aspects based on findings from Antunes et al.</p>
<p>Blanc-Rouchosse et al. (2019) explored multi-agent coordination for demand response using smart IoT devices, proposing an architecture that influenced our agent-based system design. However, their coordination approach relied on centralized control, whereas our system balances centralized optimization with decentralized device-specific logic.</p>
<h4>Areas for Further Advancement in Existing Research</h4>
<p>While previous works (such as those by Antunes et al., 2022; Bradac et al., 2014; Gerards et al., 2015) have made significant progress in MILP-based energy management and whole-building optimization, our literature review identified several areas where further advancements could be beneficial:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Integration of Learned Behavior Patterns</strong>: While some existing systems incorporate user preferences, many still rely on fixed rules or theoretical user models rather than systematically learning actual usage patterns from historical data. Antunes et al. (2022) began addressing this with probability distributions, which we extend with machine learning techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tighter Probabilistic-MILP Integration</strong>: Although both probabilistic modeling and MILP optimization have been studied extensively (with notable work by Bradac et al., 2014 on MILP formulations), opportunities remain for tighter integration of these approaches within unified frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive Continuous Learning</strong>: Building on static optimization approaches, we identify opportunities to create systems that continuously adapt to changing user behaviors over time through closed-loop feedback mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical Implementation Considerations</strong>: Academic research (including Gerards et al., 2015) has established strong theoretical foundations, which we extend by addressing practical deployment considerations like MLflow integration and scalable architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Market Adaptability</strong>: Extending market-specific solutions, our approach considers adaptability to diverse pricing environments, from developed markets to evolving contexts like Curaçao.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our Energy Management System builds upon these existing foundations by combining probabilistic device usage modeling with robust MILP optimization in a continuously learning framework, addressing these areas for advancement.</p>

</ul>
<h3>3.3 Architecture Design</h3>
<p>The Energy Management System (EMS) implements a hierarchical <strong>agent-based architecture</strong>, purpose-built for modularity, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This architectural choice enables the EMS to coordinate decentralized decision-making elements—such as device-specific agents, battery managers, PV forecasters, and grid interfaces—within a unified and production-compliant framework.</p>
<p>Each agent operates as an autonomous unit with strict responsibilities, facilitating rapid experimentation, clear separation of concerns, and smooth integration into production environments. This approach is critical for maintaining flexibility and traceability in energy systems where components operate under uncertainty and across diverse timescales.</p>
<h4>3.3.1 High-Level Architecture</h4>
<p>The system architecture is structured across five primary layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Layer</strong><br />
   Manages data acquisition, cleaning, storage, and schema consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Layer</strong><br />
   Hosts predictive models that learn device usage patterns, user behavior, and seasonal dynamics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimization Layer</strong><br />
   Implements mathematical scheduling, including MILP-based optimizers and cost minimizers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration Layer</strong><br />

</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Figure 1: EMS System Architecture</em></p>
<h4>3.3.2 Component Overview (Agent-Based Structure)</h4>
<p>The EMS is composed of multiple specialized agents, each handling a distinct part of the system's control, prediction, or interaction logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GlobalOptimizer</strong> (Primary Optimization Layer)<br />
  Performs phase-based MILP optimization across devices and assets. Only <code>optimize_phases_centralized()</code> is permitted in production, replacing earlier monolithic methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ProbabilityModelAgent</strong> (Learning Layer)<br />
  Learns from historical usage data using entropy metrics (Jensen-Shannon divergence), manages dual priors (uniform vs learned), and adapts model parameters with configurable learning rates (Appendix E.3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FlexibleDeviceAgent</strong> (Device Control Layer)<br />
  Encapsulates device-specific constraints across three operational types: <code>discrete_phase</code>, <code>partial_usage</code>, and <code>fixed</code>. Also supports season-awareness and PV-based flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BatteryAgent / EVAgent</strong> (Energy Storage Layer)<br />
  Manages state of charge (SOC), degradation, and arbitrage logic. <code>EVAgent</code> adds support for required SOC by departure hour (<code>must_be_full_by_hour = 7 AM</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PVAgent</strong> (Renewables Layer)<br />
  Forecasts solar generation with uncertainty quantification and integrates both historical and weather-derived PV profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GridAgent</strong> (Market Interface Layer)<br />
  Encodes import/export tariffs (0.25 €/kWh import, 0.05 €/kWh export) and grid constraints. Used in cost-aware dispatch planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GlobalConnectionLayer</strong><br />
  Coordinates inter-device load balancing, manages building-level exports, and facilitates constraint propagation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WeatherAgent</strong><br />
  Ingests temperature, irradiance, and humidity data for modeling battery efficiency, PV output, and user behavior priors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.3 Data Flow</h4>
<p>The EMS enforces strict data interface contracts across all agents and layers. Core mechanisms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DuckDB Integration</strong><br />
  Used for zero-copy analytical data access and schema enforcement via <code>common.get_con()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration Management</strong><br />
  Global YAML-based system (<code>config/default.yaml</code>) with environment variable overrides for cloud or test deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MLflow Tracking</strong><br />
  Every optimization run and model update is logged using <code>EMS_OptimizationTracker</code>, enabling full auditability and reproducibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.4 Rationale: Why Agent-Based?</h4>
<p>The choice to structure the EMS as an agent-based system stems from deep control theory and software engineering principles. Unlike monolithic schedulers or rule-based dispatchers, agents allow independent adaptation and localized learning—essential for modern demand-side response.</p>
<p>Key motivations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong><br />
  Each agent focuses on a narrow scope (e.g., PV forecasting or device control), simplifying testing, debugging, and iterative development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong><br />
  New optimization strategies or devices can be added without modifying core logic, ensuring the system evolves gracefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptability to Uncertainty</strong><br />
  Agents like the <code>ProbabilityModelAgent</code> embed probabilistic modeling directly into the scheduling loop, enabling the system to adjust to behavioral or environmental variance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance and Deployment Readiness</strong><br />
  Agents are designed to meet production criteria: standalone test coverage, configuration decoupling, and metrics logging—ensuring stability and traceability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong><br />
  Prediction, optimization, and orchestration responsibilities are cleanly isolated, aligning with modern control system design for multi-agent coordination under constraints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a modular, interpretable, and adaptive architecture that accommodates real-world deployment needs while remaining grounded in optimization and control theory best practices.Z</p>

<h3>3.4 Methodology</h3>
<p>This section details our technical approach to developing the Energy Management System, focusing on the integration of probabilistic device usage modeling with MILP optimization. Our methodology employs a five-stage pipeline that processes historical data, learns user behavior patterns, optimizes device schedules, handles uncertainty, and continuously improves through feedback.</p>
<h3>3.4.1 Data Preprocessing and Analysis</h3>
<p>The first stage of our pipeline involves collecting, cleaning, and processing energy consumption data to prepare it for subsequent machine learning and optimization steps.</p>
<h4>Data Sources and Collection</h4>
<p>Our system works with two primary types of data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Building-level Energy Data</strong>: Collected via smart meters, this includes aggregate consumption and, where available, grid import/export measurements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device-level Consumption Data</strong>: Gathered through IoT devices or sub-metering systems, this provides granular insights into individual appliance usage patterns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For development and testing, we primarily utilized the CoSSMic Project dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CoSSMic Project Data</strong>: Energy data from 11 buildings (residential, industrial, and public) in Konstanz, Germany, collected at 1-minute resolution. The dataset includes detailed measurements of grid import/export, PV generation, and individual appliance consumption (dishwashers, freezers, heat pumps, washing machines, etc.). The data was accessed through the Open Power System Data platform (https://data.open-power-system-data.org/household_data/).</li>
<li><strong>UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity)</strong>: A publicly available dataset containing device-level electricity consumption from UK households, which we processed to focus on schedulable devices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Cleaning and Standardization</h4>
<p>Our data preprocessing pipeline handles data cleaning and standardization with the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Series Alignment</strong>: Ensuring all timestamps are standardized to consistent intervals (typically hourly for optimization, with sub-hourly data aggregated appropriately).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing Value Handling</strong>: The CoSSMic dataset already includes an 'interpolated' column that indicates which values were missing in the source data. In our preprocessing pipeline, we specifically:</p>
</li>
<li>Apply pandas' forward-fill (<code>ffill</code>) method for short gaps</li>
<li>Create validity flags to mark periods with excessive missing data (&gt;24 consecutive hours) for exclusion from training</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain a log of gap locations and durations for data quality assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outlier Detection and Correction</strong>: Implemented a statistical approach using:</p>
</li>
<li>IQR (Interquartile Range) method: Values beyond Q3 + 1.5<em>IQR or below Q1 - 1.5</em>IQR were flagged</li>
<li>
<p>For appliances, values exceeding device-specific thresholds (e.g., &gt;5kWh for a single hour for residential dishwashers) were capped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device Classification</strong>: Categorizing devices based on their flexibility model for MILP optimization:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Discrete Phase (<code>flex_model: "discrete_phase"</code>)</strong>: Devices with fixed operating cycles that must run completely once started (e.g., dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, oven)</li>
<li><strong>Partial Usage (<code>flex_model: "partial_usage"</code>)</strong>: Devices whose operation can be spread over time with flexible energy distribution (e.g., EV charging, water heater, heat pump)</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Consumption (<code>flex_model: "continuous"</code>)</strong>: Devices with ongoing operation that can be modulated within constraints (e.g., refrigerator, freezer)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-flexible (<code>flex_model: "none"</code>)</strong>: Devices with fixed consumption patterns that cannot be shifted (grouped into "other_devices")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Creating derived features to enhance model performance, including:</p>
</li>
<li>Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, weekend indicator)</li>
<li>Rolling statistical measures (7-day average usage)</li>
<li>Weather correlation features (temperature, solar radiation)</li>
<li>Device-specific metrics (time since last usage, peak usage ratio)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data preparation process follows a systematic workflow that processes building energy data to create both daily and hourly feature sets. The workflow includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loading</strong>: The system loads processed parquet files for each building, handling time zone conversions to ensure consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering - Daily Level</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Usage Patterns</strong>: Rolling 7-day average usage statistics to capture weekly patterns</li>
<li><strong>Cyclical Time Features</strong>: Previous day's peak usage hour (transformed using sine/cosine encoding)</li>
<li><strong>Binary Usage Indicators</strong>: Target flags indicating whether a device was used that day (based on dynamic thresholds)</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Weather data and PV forecast aggregates</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calendar Features</strong>: Day of week and weekend indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering - Hourly Level</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Usage Patterns</strong>: Cumulative usage statistics throughout the day and hourly energy consumption</li>
<li><strong>Cyclical Time Features</strong>: Sine/cosine transformations of hour of day</li>
<li><strong>Binary Usage Indicators</strong>: Flags for device operation in each hour</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Temperature, solar radiation, and related weather data</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calendar Features</strong>: Hour of day, part of day (morning/afternoon/evening/night), weekday/weekend indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Threshold Determination</strong>: Dynamic thresholds are calculated for each device based on the distribution of positive usage values, allowing the system to adapt to different consumption patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Output Generation</strong>: The process creates two structured datasets:</p>
</li>
<li>A daily dataframe for predicting whether a device will be used on a specific day</li>
<li>An hourly dataframe for modeling the distribution of usage across hours for days when the device is used</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive feature engineering approach enables the subsequent machine learning models to capture both macro patterns (which days devices are used) and micro patterns (which hours within those days).</p>
<h4>CoSSMic Dataset Processing</h4>
<p>We applied specific preprocessing steps to the CoSSMic dataset to prepare it for our modeling pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Device Selection and Classification</strong>: We identified and categorized the available devices in the CoSSMic dataset:</li>
<li><strong>Discrete Phase Devices</strong>: Dishwashers (<code>DE_KN_residential1_dishwasher</code>, <code>DE_KN_residential2_dishwasher</code>, etc.), washing machines (<code>DE_KN_residential1_washing_machine</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Partial Usage Devices</strong>: Heat pumps (<code>DE_KN_residential1_heat_pump</code>, <code>DE_KN_residential4_heat_pump</code>), EV chargers (<code>DE_KN_residential4_ev</code>, <code>DE_KN_industrial3_ev</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Devices</strong>: Refrigerators (<code>DE_KN_residential3_refrigerator</code>, etc.), freezers (<code>DE_KN_residential1_freezer</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PV Generation</strong>: Multiple PV sources across buildings (<code>DE_KN_residential1_pv</code>, <code>DE_KN_residential3_pv</code>, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Resolution Standardization</strong>: </p>
</li>
<li>We used the 60-minute resolution dataset (<code>household_data_60min_singleindex.csv</code>) as our primary source</li>
<li>
<p>The timestamps were properly converted between UTC and CET/CEST using the provided dual timestamp columns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Interpolated Data</strong>: </p>
</li>
<li>The dataset includes an <code>interpolated</code> column that indicates which values were missing in the source data</li>
<li>
<p>We created validity flags to track periods with interpolated data for quality control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building-Specific Processing</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>For each building (e.g., <code>DE_KN_residential1</code>, <code>DE_KN_residential2</code>), we created separate parquet files</li>
<li>
<p>Grid import/export, device-level consumption, and PV generation were grouped by building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weather Data Integration</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Weather data for Konstanz, Germany was matched to the dataset's timestamp resolution</li>
<li>Temperature, solar radiation, and other relevant weather parameters were aligned with the energy data</li>
</ol>
<p>The UK-DALE dataset was processed using a similar approach for consistency, with device names standardized to match the CoSSMic naming conventions. Both datasets were then formatted into uniform parquet files for efficient access by the machine learning pipeline.</p>
<h3>3.4.2 Machine Learning for Device Usage Prediction</h3>
<p>Building upon established approaches in the literature, this work employs a two-stage machine learning pipeline to derive probabilistic usage patterns from historical consumption data. This data-driven methodology facilitates the identification and adaptation to household-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enabling far more precise energy scheduling compared to static rule-based systems or theoretical usage models.</p>
<h4>Two-Stage Prediction Framework</h4>
<p>Our device usage prediction framework consists of two complementary models:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Usage Model (LightGBM)</strong>: Predicts whether a device will be used on a given day</li>
<li><strong>Hourly Usage Model (CatBoost)</strong>: For days when the device is predicted to be used, determines the probability distribution of usage across different hours</li>
</ol>
<p>This two-stage approach allows us to accurately model both the temporal patterns of device usage (which days devices are used) and the time-of-day preferences (which hours within those days).</p>
<h5>Daily Usage Prediction with LightGBM</h5>
<p>For the daily prediction task, we implemented a LightGBM classifier with calibrated probabilities. This model determines the likelihood that a specific device will be used on a given day based on historical patterns and contextual features.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Model Training Process:</strong></p>
<p>The system trains daily device usage prediction models using LightGBM gradient boosting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Temporal features (day of week, holidays), weather data, and rolling usage statistics are incorporated while excluding non-predictive variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Training</strong>: LightGBM uses optimized hyperparameters (see Appendix E.1) with binary cross-entropy loss and cross-building validation to ensure generalization to new environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Models achieve AUC scores of 0.78-0.88 across device types, with probability calibration ensuring accurate likelihood estimates for optimization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key features include weather patterns, temporal cycles, historical usage averages, and circular-encoded peak usage times.</p>
<h5>Hourly Usage Prediction with CatBoost</h5>
<p>For the hourly prediction task, we implemented a CatBoost classifier to model the probability distribution across different hours of the day. This model captures fine-grained temporal patterns and user preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Hourly Model Training Process:</strong></p>
<p>The system trains hourly usage prediction models using CatBoost gradient boosting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Processing</strong>: Categorical features (hour, day of week, weekend indicators) receive specialized encoding while excluding non-predictive variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Training</strong>: CatBoost uses optimized hyperparameters (see Appendix E.2) with log loss and cross-building validation ensuring generalization to unseen buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Models achieve AUC scores of 0.75-0.85, effectively distinguishing usage vs idle hours across device types.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key features include hour-of-day (raw and circular-encoded), day context, and weekend indicators.
- <strong>Weather conditions</strong>: Temperature, solar radiation at the specific hour
- <strong>Usage context</strong>: Cumulative usage earlier in the day, time since last usage
- <strong>Relative usage patterns</strong>: Peak usage ratio, previous hour state</p>
<p>CatBoost was selected for this task due to its strong performance with categorical features (hour of day, day of week) and its ability to handle the complex, non-linear relationships between these features and device usage patterns.</p>
<h4>Hourly Probability Mass Function Generation</h4>
<p>The EMS generates hourly probability distributions for device usage through a structured process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Extraction</strong>: For each hour, device-specific features are extracted from historical data, including time context, past usage patterns, and environmental factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Probability Calculation</strong>: The trained model evaluates these features to generate a raw probability value for each hour of the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Probability Mass Function Formation</strong>: These individual hour probabilities are aggregated and normalized to form a valid probability mass function (PMF) where all values sum to 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fallback Mechanisms</strong>: To ensure robustness, the system implements fallback strategies such as:</p>
</li>
<li>For devices with insufficient data, returning a low-probability distribution</li>
<li>For cases where normalization fails, defaulting to a uniform distribution across all hours</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures that valid hourly probability distributions are always available for the optimization process, even in edge cases or when dealing with new devices.</p>
<h3>3.4.3 Continuous Learning with Adaptive PMFs</h3>
<p>The <code>ProbabilityModelAgent</code> class implements a continuous learning mechanism that updates device usage probability mass functions (PMFs) based on daily observed usage. This enables the system to align its scheduling logic with evolving user behavior over time.</p>
<p>The learning approach is inspired by Bayesian updating but incorporates several safeguards to maintain robustness and convergence stability. Rather than replacing distributions outright, each update incrementally adjusts the prior based on new evidence—using adaptive, capped learning to balance sensitivity and noise resistance.</p>
<p>The update logic consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong>  </li>
<li>For devices without prior data, the PMF is initialized using knowledge transferred from similar device types.  </li>
<li>
<p>Separate priors are maintained for weekdays and weekends to capture behavior variation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Triggering and Management</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Updates occur once per device per day unless explicitly configured otherwise.  </li>
<li>
<p>Each update is tagged with metadata (e.g., timestamp, previous entropy, device class) to support traceability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive Learning Rate Calculation</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>The learning rate is computed dynamically, based on:<ul>
<li>Total number of past updates for that device</li>
<li>Time since last update</li>
<li>Divergence between previous and current distributions</li>
<li>Entropy stability over time  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning rates decay with more observations but increase temporarily if recent behavior deviates significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guided Update and Capping</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>The system boosts the probability at the <strong>observed usage hour</strong>, while proportionally decreasing other values.  </li>
<li>
<p>To prevent instability, update magnitudes are capped:</p>
<ul>
<li>Max update size is proportional to the adaptive learning rate.</li>
<li>All updates are clipped to ensure non-negativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normalization and Validity Enforcement</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>After applying updates, the entire PMF is normalized to ensure that the distribution sums to 1.0.  </li>
<li>
<p>This step guarantees numerical validity and interpretability as a true PMF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convergence Monitoring</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>After each update, three diagnostics are computed:<ul>
<li><strong>Jensen-Shannon Divergence</strong> from the previous PMF</li>
<li><strong>Incremental delta</strong> between updates</li>
<li><strong>Entropy trend</strong> to track distribution spread  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These metrics allow the system to detect both convergence and drift, enabling proactive behavior correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical Logging</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>All updates are recorded with full metadata (previous PMF, update delta, divergence, timestamp), enabling:<ul>
<li>Post-hoc debugging</li>
<li>Visualization of long-term learning trajectories</li>
<li>Drift detection for model retraining alerts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Adaptive Learning Rate &amp; Update Rule</h4>
<p>The EMS employs a <strong>non-linear, feedback-driven update rule</strong> with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning-rate calculation</strong></p>
<p>$$
lr \;=\; \frac{1}{\,n+\tau\,}
$$</p>
<p>where  </p>
<ul>
<li>$n$: total number of observations  </li>
<li>$\tau$: time constant  </li>
</ul>
<p>The learning-rate $lr$ is then dynamically rescaled using Jensen–Shannon divergence
trends and entropy drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update rule</strong></p>
<p>$$\Delta_h = lr \cdot (target_h - p_{old,h})$$</p>
<p>Updates are capped</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_h \;=\;
\operatorname{clip}!\bigl(\Delta_h,\,-\text{cap},\,+\text{cap}\bigr)
$$</p>
<p>Finally, all probabilities are clamped to $[0,1]$ and re-normalised</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diagnostic Metrics for Convergence</h4>
<p>The system continuously audits model learning with robust convergence diagnostics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jensen-Shannon Divergence</strong><br />
  Quantifies similarity between successive PMFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entropy Evolution</strong><br />
  Tracks confidence in predictions (high entropy = uncertain model)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-N Shift Monitoring</strong><br />
  Logs how frequently the most likely hour shifts—a proxy for drift</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics allow for dynamic model stabilization and drift detection. For example, rising divergence triggers a temporary spike in learning rate, encouraging faster adaptation.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Historical Logging &amp; Auditability</h4>
<p>Each update is archived with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre- and post-update PMFs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Delta vectors</strong></li>
<li><strong>Timestamps and entropy values</strong></li>
<li><strong>Device ID and day type (weekday/weekend)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging of model behavior</li>
<li>Longitudinal visualization of usage pattern evolution</li>
<li>Automated retraining flags in case of distribution instability</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Rolling Horizon Integration</h4>
<p>The entire pipeline operates in a <strong>rolling horizon framework</strong>, where yesterday’s observations inform today’s model, and today’s model informs tomorrow’s schedule. This allows the EMS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain <strong>responsive</strong> to evolving usage patterns  </li>
<li>Preserve <strong>stability</strong> under normal conditions  </li>
<li>Ensure <strong>continuity</strong> of device preferences across days  </li>
<li>Improve <strong>schedule effectiveness</strong> over time</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The <code>ProbabilityModelAgent</code> and its learning pipeline form the <strong>adaptive backbone</strong> of the EMS, enabling it to function as a <strong>living system</strong>—one that continually learns from its environment, adapts its models, and improves its recommendations.</p>
<p>This adaptive PMF framework allows each device’s probability model to evolve with observed usage while remaining stable, interpretable, and production-ready. The combination of entropy metrics, capped learning, and historical auditing ensures that learning is neither overfitted to recent noise nor oblivious to long-term changes.</p>
<p>As a result, the EMS continuously aligns optimization schedules with actual user behavior, supporting personalized, data-driven demand-side management at scale.</p>
<h3>3.4.4 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Optimization</h3>
<p>At the core of our Energy Management System is a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization framework that schedules device operations, battery charging/discharging, and PV utilization to minimize electricity costs while respecting both technical constraints and user preferences. The integration of probabilistic device usage patterns as soft constraints within the MILP formulation is central to our approach.</p>
<h4>Optimization Framework Overview</h4>
<p>Our optimization framework employs a hierarchical approach with three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Device-Level Optimization</strong>: Each flexible device is modeled with specific operational constraints and optimization objectives</li>
<li><strong>Building-Level Coordination</strong>: A global coordination layer ensures that all devices operate within the building's overall capacity constraints</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic Integration</strong>: The probability mass functions (PMFs) generated by the machine learning models are incorporated as soft constraints to guide device scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>This hierarchical structure allows the system to balance global optimization goals (minimizing total cost) with device-specific requirements (respecting operational constraints) and user preferences (aligning with likely usage patterns).</p>
<h4>Device Categorization and Modeling</h4>
<p>Our system classifies devices into categories based on their operational characteristics and flexibility, as defined in the device specifications:</p>
<h5>1. <strong>Discrete Phase Devices</strong> (<code>flex_model: 'discrete_phase'</code>):</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Dishwashers, washing machines, dryers</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Operate in distinct phases with fixed power levels and durations</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Can be scheduled within allowed hours but must complete all phases in sequence</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Modeled with phase-specific power requirements and temporal constraints</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. <strong>Partial Usage Devices</strong> (<code>flex_model: 'partial_usage'</code>):</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: EV chargers, heat pumps, circulation pumps</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Can operate at variable times and be interrupted</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Energy can be distributed flexibly within a time window</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Modeled with total energy requirements and flexible scheduling constraints</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. <strong>Fixed Operation Devices</strong> (<code>flex_model: 'fixed'</code>):</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Refrigerators, freezers</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Continuously operating with minimal flexibility</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Limited to minor timing adjustments of duty cycles</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Modeled with baseline consumption patterns and tight operational constraints</li>
</ul>
<h5>4. <strong>Always On Devices</strong> (<code>category: 'Always On'</code>):</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Lighting, network equipment</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Must remain powered during specified hours</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Minimal flexibility, primarily for emergency load shedding</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Modeled with fixed consumption patterns and high-priority constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>Each device category is modeled with specific constraints that capture its operational requirements and flexibility characteristics. This detailed modeling ensures that the optimization produces schedules that are both technically feasible and aligned with the device's intended operation.</p>
<h4>MILP Formulation</h4>
<p>The optimization problem schedules devices over a 24-hour planning horizon while respecting device-specific constraints and user preferences. The formulation is implemented as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to handle both continuous and discrete decision variables effectively.</p>
<h5>Key Components:</h5>
<h6>1. <strong>Objective Function:</strong></h6>
<p>The primary objective is to minimize the total electricity cost while considering user preferences and system constraints:</p>
<p>$$\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[ p_t \cdot g_t^+ - p_t^{\text{export}} \cdot g_t^- + \sum_{d \in D} w_d \cdot (1 - P_{d,t}) \cdot x_{d,t} \right]$$</p>
<p>Where $p_t$ is the electricity price, $g_t^+$ is grid import, $g_t^-$ is grid export, $P_{d,t}$ is the probability of device $d$ being used at time $t$, and $x_{d,t}$ is the device scheduling decision variable.</p>
<h6>2. <strong>Key Constraints:</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Power Balance:</strong>
$$g_t^+ - g_t^- = \sum_{d \in D} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b_t^{\text{charge}} - b_t^{\text{discharge}} - s_t$$</p>
<p><strong>Battery SOC Evolution:</strong>
$$\text{SOC}_{t+1} = \text{SOC}_t + \eta \cdot b_t^{\text{charge}} - \frac{b_t^{\text{discharge}}}{\eta}$$</p>
<p><strong>Device Scheduling:</strong>
$$\sum_{k} x_{d,k} = 1 \quad \forall d \in D_{\text{discrete}}$$</p>
<p>Where $c_{d,t}$ is device consumption, $b_t$ represents battery power flows, $s_t$ is PV generation, $\eta$ is battery efficiency, and $D_{\text{discrete}}$ is the set of discrete-phase devices.</p>
<h6>3. <strong>Decision Variables</strong>:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Device activation states (binary)</li>
<li>Battery charging/discharging rates</li>
<li>Grid import/export levels</li>
<li>State of charge (SOC) for batteries</li>
</ul>
<h6>4. <strong>Device Categories</strong>:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discrete Phase Devices</strong> (e.g., washing machines): Must complete sequential operation phases</li>
<li><strong>Partial Usage Devices</strong> (e.g., EV chargers): Flexible energy allocation within time windows</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Operation Devices</strong> (e.g., refrigerators): Minimal scheduling flexibility</li>
<li><strong>Always On Devices</strong>: Critical loads with strict uptime requirements</li>
</ul>
<h6>5. <strong>Core Constraints</strong>:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Power balance (generation = consumption)</li>
<li>Device operational requirements</li>
<li>Battery charge/discharge limits</li>
<li>Grid connection capacity</li>
<li>User preference probabilities</li>
</ul>
<h6>6. <strong>Battery Operation Model</strong></h6>
<p>The battery operation model optimizes charging and discharging decisions to maximize economic value through price arbitrage and PV self-consumption. Key components include:</p>
<ul>
<li>State of charge (SOC) tracking across time periods</li>
<li>Charging/discharging power limits and efficiency factors</li>
<li>Degradation cost modeling for lifecycle optimization</li>
<li>Grid export limitation and PV utilization maximization</li>
</ul>
<p>The model ensures battery operations complement device scheduling decisions while maintaining system reliability.</p>
<p>A detailed mathematical formulation of the MILP model, including all variables, parameters, and constraints, is provided in Appendix A.</p>
<h4>Implementation Approach</h4>
<p>The optimization employs a rolling horizon approach, where the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solves the MILP for a 24-hour look-ahead window</li>
<li>Implements the first time period's decisions</li>
<li>Shifts the window forward by one time period</li>
<li>Repeats the process with updated system states and forecasts</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach allows the system to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining computational tractability. The implementation uses the PuLP library in Python, which provides a flexible interface to various MILP solvers.</p>
<p>Key implementation considerations include:
- Handling of different device types through specialized constraints
- Integration of probability forecasts for user preferences
- Efficient handling of time-coupling constraints
- Warm-start capabilities for faster convergence
- Robustness to forecast errors through receding horizon control</p>
<p>For the complete mathematical formulation, including all equations and constraints, please refer to Appendix A.</p>
<h4>Implementation in PuLP</h4>
<p>The MILP problem is implemented using the PuLP library, which provides a Python interface to various MILP solvers. The core implementation includes decision variables for device scheduling, battery operation, and grid interaction, with an objective function that minimizes total costs while incorporating probability-based penalties for user preference violations (see Listing A-2).</p>
<p>This implementation captures the essential elements of our MILP formulation, including the integration of probability-based penalties in the objective function. In practice, our implementation includes additional constraints and features to handle the specific operational characteristics of different device types.</p>
<h4>Integration with Probability Models</h4>
<p>The integration of probability models with the MILP optimization occurs through one practical way:</p>
<p><strong>Soft Constraints via Objective Function Penalties</strong>:
   - The objective function includes a penalty term that discourages scheduling devices at times with low probability of use
   - The penalty is weighted to balance cost minimization with user preference satisfaction</p>
<p>The <code>ProbabilityModelAgent</code> class manages this integration, refreshing device constraints every time new probability distributions are learned:</p>
<p><strong>Device Constraint Management Process:</strong></p>
<p>The system dynamically updates device operational constraints based on the latest probability distributions through a structured process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution Retrieval</strong>: For each device, the system pulls the latest hourly PMF from the agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Synchronization</strong>: The probability distribution is attached to the in-memory device object so the optimizer sees a consistent view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Candidate-Hour Selection</strong>: For flexible devices (dishwashers, washers, EV chargers, etc.):</p>
</li>
<li>The system keeps only the hours above the set probability threshold</li>
<li>
<p>This approach significantly reduces the search space for the optimizer while maintaining user preference alignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase-Aware Filtering</strong>: For devices with multi-phase cycles:</p>
</li>
<li>The system verifies the allowed window can accommodate the full sequence</li>
<li>Windows that cannot support complete phase sequences are discarded</li>
<li>
<p>This prevents the scheduler from starting operations that cannot complete within the preferred timeframe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constraint Application</strong>: The final allowed-hour set is passed to the MILP as a hard constraint, while the probability penalty fine-tunes placement inside that window</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This mechanism ensures that the optimization respects user preferences while still finding cost-effective schedules. The balance between cost minimization and preference satisfaction can be adjusted through the weighting parameter <code>w_prob</code>.</p>
<h3>3.4.5 Uncertainty Handling and Robust Optimization</h3>
<p>In real-world energy systems, uncertainty is unavoidable and occurs in multiple forms. Rather than ignoring these uncertainties or making simplistic assumptions, our system explicitly accounts for them through robust optimization techniques that create resilient schedules capable of performing well across a range of possible future conditions.</p>
<h4>Sources of Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Our system methodically addresses three critical sources of uncertainty that impact energy management decisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User Behavior Uncertainty</strong>: Even with the most capable prediction models, exact timing of when a user will run a dishwasher or charge an electric vehicle remains inherently variable. Our system captures this uncertainty through learned probability distributions that quantify the likelihood of device usage across different hours and days. These distributions reveal patterns (such as higher washing machine usage on weekends) while acknowledging their probabilistic nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PV Generation Uncertainty</strong>: Solar energy production depends on highly variable weather conditions that can deviate significantly from forecasts. Our system characterizes this uncertainty by analyzing historical forecast errors and modeling their distribution. This approach captures both systematic errors (like consistent under-prediction during partially cloudy conditions) and random variations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Scenario-Based Robust Optimization</h4>
<p>To address these uncertainties systematically, we implemented a scenario-based robust optimization approach, inspired by the work of Kanakadhurga &amp; Prabaharan (2024). This method strikes an effective balance between computational feasibility and schedule resilience, ensuring that the system makes decisions that perform well regardless of which future scenario actually materializes.</p>
<p>The scenario generation process follows a structured methodology:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User Behavior Scenarios</strong>: The system generates multiple plausible device usage patterns by sampling from the learned probability distributions. For instance, if the washing machine has a 70% probability of being used between 9-11 AM on weekends, the system creates scenarios both with and without washing machine usage during these hours, weighted appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PV Generation Scenarios</strong>: Multiple possible solar generation profiles are created by applying statistical variations to the base forecast. These variations are carefully calibrated to match observed historical error patterns, capturing both over-prediction and under-prediction cases that might occur due to weather forecast inaccuracies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The system implements this approach through a structured scenario generation and robust optimization process:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario Generation Process:</strong>
1. For each device, possible usage patterns are created by statistical sampling from the probability mass functions, creating distinct scenarios that reflect different possible user behaviors
2. PV generation scenarios are created by applying calibrated error distributions (typically with 15% standard deviation) to the base forecast, ensuring physical constraints like non-negative generation are maintained
3. The complete set of scenarios (typically 5-10) captures the key uncertainties while remaining computationally tractable</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Scenario Optimization:</strong>
1. The system formulates an optimization problem that incorporates all scenarios simultaneously
2. Decision variables are categorized as first-stage (must be identical across all scenarios) and second-stage (can vary by scenario) to reflect real-world decision making constraints
3. The objective function becomes a weighted sum of scenario-specific objectives, with weights reflecting scenario probabilities
4. Linking constraints ensure coherence between common variables and scenario-specific variables
5. The optimization is solved using mathematical programming techniques with extended time limits to accommodate the increased problem complexity
6. Solution extraction processes identify robust schedules that perform well across all considered futures</p>
<p>This multi-scenario approach produces schedules that minimize expected costs while hedging against unfavorable outcomes, similar to how a diversified investment portfolio manages financial risks. The resulting schedules demonstrate robustness by maintaining good performance even when actual conditions deviate significantly from predictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scope note:</strong> In the current project we apply this robust scenario framework primarily to the <strong>electric-vehicle (EV) charger</strong>, the highest-energy, time-critical load. Other flexible devices are still optimized under single-scenario behavior, as users can more readily adjust their operation times.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Handling PV Forecast Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Solar energy generation presents particularly challenging forecasting problems due to its strong dependence on weather conditions and atmospheric factors. Our system addresses these challenges through :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Characterization</strong>: The system continuously analyzes the differences between predicted and actual PV generation, building error distribution models. These models capture not just the magnitude of errors but their statistical properties and correlations with factors like cloud cover variability, time of day, and season.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Parametric Scenario Generation</strong>: Instead of assuming that forecast errors follow standard statistical distributions (like normal distributions), our system employs kernel density estimation techniques to model the actual empirical error patterns. This approach captures the complex, often non-normal error distributions typically seen in PV forecasting, such as skewed distributions with long tails that represent rare but significant prediction failures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Adaptive Recourse Decisions</h4>
<p>Our system implements a two-stage decision process that combines day-ahead optimization with continuous learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Next-Day Scheduling</strong>: The system performs optimization once per day when day-ahead prices become available. This creates a complete 24-hour schedule using the current device probability models and available forecasts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Learning Updates</strong>: As device usage is observed throughout each day, the system updates its internal probability models. These updates don't alter the current day's schedule but enhance future scheduling decisions by incorporating the latest observed patterns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach balances forward-looking optimization with adaptive learning, allowing the system to gradually align its scheduling decisions with the household's evolving usage patterns.</p>
<h4>MLflow Model Tracking and Deployment</h4>
<p>To ensure reproducibility and facilitate deployment, all models are tracked using MLflow. This allows us to version models, compare different training runs, and deploy the best-performing models to production.</p>
<p><strong>Model Logging and Registration Process:</strong></p>
<p>The system implements a comprehensive approach to model tracking and registration:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Experiment Organization</strong>:</li>
<li>Each training run is organized within MLflow's experiment tracking system</li>
<li>Device-specific naming conventions ensure clear categorization of model runs</li>
<li>
<p>This systematic approach enables easy filtering and comparison across different device types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parameter Documentation</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Critical model parameters are automatically logged to ensure reproducibility</li>
<li>Device type and model architecture information is preserved for future reference</li>
<li>
<p>This metadata enables proper contextualization of model performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Metrics Tracking</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>All relevant performance metrics are systematically recorded</li>
<li>Metrics typically include AUC, precision, recall, and other classification metrics</li>
<li>
<p>This comprehensive tracking enables performance comparison across model iterations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dual Model Registration</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Both daily and hourly models are registered in the central model registry</li>
<li>Standardized naming conventions combine device type with model purpose</li>
<li>Proper artifact organization ensures all model files are correctly preserved</li>
<li>This structured approach facilitates streamlined deployment and version control</li>
</ol>
<p>This integration with MLflow provides several benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Model Versioning</strong>: Each training run creates a new version of the model, allowing us to track changes over time</li>
<li><strong>Performance Comparison</strong>: Metrics from different training runs can be easily compared to identify the best-performing models</li>
<li><strong>Artifact Management</strong>: Model files, along with associated metadata, are stored in a centralized location</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Automation</strong>: Registered models can be easily deployed to production environments</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: All parameters and data used for training are tracked, ensuring reproducibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The PMFs generated by these models serve as a key input to the MILP optimization process, guiding the scheduling of devices to periods when they are most likely to be used while also considering electricity prices and other constraints.</p>

<p>We evaluated the EMS using data from multiple buildings with different device configurations, energy consumption patterns, and optional DERs (PV systems and batteries). The evaluation includes the following scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline Scenario</strong>: Original consumption without optimization</li>
<li><strong>Cost Optimization</strong>: Optimization focused solely on minimizing energy costs</li>
<li><strong>User Preference Optimization</strong>: Optimization balancing cost reduction and user preferences</li>
<li><strong>Full DER Integration</strong>: Optimization with PV and battery integration</li>
</ol>
<p>Each scenario was evaluated over multiple time periods to account for seasonal variations and different user behavior patterns.</p>
<h4>4.1.1 Experimental Dataset Characteristics</h4>
<h5>Dataset Sources and Composition</h5>
<p>Our evaluation leveraged a comprehensive, multi-building dataset containing detailed energy consumption records, renewable generation profiles, and external variables (pricing, weather) across diverse building types. The complete dataset is structured as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Data Source</strong>: The CoSSMic Project dataset from Konstanz, Germany, accessed through the Open Power System Data platform (https://data.open-power-system-data.org/household_data/). This dataset was selected for its high temporal resolution (1-minute intervals), device-level granularity, and inclusion of both residential and industrial buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building Portfolio Composition</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Building</strong>: DE_KN_industrial3 (990 m² commercial property with combined office and light manufacturing spaces)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Residential Buildings</strong>: Six distinct single-family homes (DE_KN_residential1 through DE_KN_residential6) with floor areas ranging from 115 m² to 210 m²</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Coverage</strong>: The dataset spans 90 consecutive days (2016-01-01 through 2016-03-31), capturing winter to spring transition with 2,160 hours of continuous operation per building. This period was specifically selected to capture both high-heating demand periods (January) and increasing PV generation (March).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Resolution</strong>: All data was sampled or resampled to hourly intervals, providing 24 data points per day per measurement channel, aligned with typical smart meter reporting intervals and day-ahead market pricing periods.</p>

<!-- 
#### 4.2.3.1 Core Mathematical Models

Our approach employs a mathematical foundation composed of five interconnected models:

1. **MILP Optimization Objective**: The global scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective function:

   $$\min_{x, b, e} \sum_{t=1}^{24} \left( p_t \cdot g_t + \lambda \cdot \sum_{d=1}^{D} w_d \cdot \text{PP}_d(t) \right)$$

   **Subject to:**

   - $g_t = \sum_{d=1}^{D} l_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b_t^{ch} - b_t^{dis} - s_t + e_t^{ch} - e_t^{dis}$
   - Device operational constraints (cycle completion, min/max run time)
   - Battery constraints (SoC limits, charging/discharging rates)
   - EV constraints (charging deadline, capacity limits)

   **Where:**

   - $p_t$ is the electricity price at hour $t$
   - $g_t$ is the net grid consumption at hour $t$
   - $\lambda$ is the preference penalty weight
   - $\text{PP}_d(t)$ is the preference penalty for device $d$ at hour $t$
   - $l_{d,t}$ is the load profile of device $d$ at hour $t$
   - $x_{d,t}$ is the binary decision variable for device $d$ operation at hour $t$
   - $b_t^{ch}$, $b_t^{dis}$ are battery charging/discharging decisions
   - $e_t^{ch}$, $e_t^{dis}$ are EV charging/discharging decisions
   - $s_t$ is the solar PV generation at hour $t$

2. **Battery Storage Model**: Battery operation is constrained by:

   $$\text{SoC}_{t+1} = \text{SoC}_t + \eta^{ch} \cdot b_t^{ch} - \frac{b_t^{dis}}{\eta^{dis}} - \gamma \cdot (b_t^{ch} + b_t^{dis})$$

   **Subject to:**

   - $\text{SoC}_{\min} \leq \text{SoC}_t \leq \text{SoC}_{\max}$
   - $0 \leq b_t^{ch} \leq P_{\max}^{ch}$
   - $0 \leq b_t^{dis} \leq P_{\max}^{dis}$

   **Where:**

   - $\text{SoC}_t$ is the battery state of charge at time $t$
   - $\eta^{ch}$, $\eta^{dis}$ are charging/discharging efficiencies (0.95 and 0.95)
   - $\gamma$ is the degradation rate (0.045 €/kWh)

3. **Electric Vehicle Model**: EV charging follows similar SoC dynamics as the battery model but with additional constraints:

   $$\text{SoC}_{t+1}^{EV} = \text{SoC}_t^{EV} + \eta^{ch} \cdot e_t^{ch} - \gamma^{EV} \cdot e_t^{ch}$$

   **Subject to:**

   - $\text{SoC}_{\min}^{EV} \leq \text{SoC}_t^{EV} \leq \text{SoC}_{\max}^{EV}$
   - $0 \leq e_t^{ch} \leq P_{\max}^{EV}$
   - $\text{SoC}_{\text{deadline}} \geq 0.98 \cdot \text{SoC}_{\max}^{EV}$

   **Where:**

   - $\text{SoC}_t^{EV}$ is the EV state of charge at time $t$
   - $e_t^{ch}$ is the EV charging power at time $t$
   - $\text{SoC}_{\text{deadline}}$ is the state of charge at departure time (e.g. 7 AM)
   - $\gamma^{EV}$ is the EV battery degradation rate

4. **Forecast Uncertainty Management**: To account for forecast uncertainty, we employ a robust formulation that adds penalty terms to the objective function:

   $$\min \sum_{t=1}^{24} \left( p_t \cdot g_t + \lambda \cdot \sum_{d=1}^{D} w_d \cdot \text{PP}_d(t) + \mu \cdot \varepsilon_t \right)$$

   **Where:**

   - $\varepsilon_t$ represents the forecast error buffer at time $t$
   - $\mu$ is the uncertainty penalty weight

5. **Adaptive Probability Model Learning**: Our system learns and updates device usage probability distributions over time using an adaptive learning rate mechanism:

   $$\alpha_t = \max \left(\alpha_{\min}, \min \left(\alpha_{\max}, \frac{\beta}{n_t + \tau}\right)\right)$$

   **Where:**

   - $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate at time $t$
   - $n_t$ is the number of observations up to time $t$
   - $\tau$ is a decay parameter controlling adaptation speed (set to 20)
   - $\beta$ is a divergence-based boost factor calculated as $1 + \min (J_S \cdot 50, 0.5)$
   - $J_S$ is the Jensen-Shannon divergence between recent probability distributions

   The probability mass function (PMF) update for each hour $h$ is then computed as:

   $$P_{t+1}(h) = P_t(h) + \delta_h$$

   Where $\delta_h$ is calculated as:

   $$\delta_h = \text{clip}\left(\alpha_t \cdot (T_h - P_t(h)), -c_t, c_t\right)$$

   - $T_h$ is the target probability (1.0 for observed hour, 0.0 otherwise)
   - $c_t$ is an adaptive update cap that prevents excessive changes

These core mathematical models work together in an agent-based architecture described below to enable our energy management system's capabilities.

##### 4.2.3.2 Agent-Based Architecture

The experimental system employed a comprehensive agent-based architecture with the following components:

1. **Central Simulation Environment**:
   - **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly decision intervals with 24-hour optimization horizon
   - **Rolling Horizon**: Daily re-optimization with 24-hour lookahead
   - **Simulation Engine**: Python-based discrete event simulation with 1-hour timesteps

2. **Agent Hierarchy and Responsibilities**:
   - **Global Optimizer Agent**: Coordinated system-wide optimization using mixed-integer linear programming
   - **Device-Specific Agents**: Maintained device-specific constraints and behavioral models
   - **Probability Model Agent**: Learned and updated device usage probability distributions
   - **Weather and PV Forecast Agents**: Provided environmental inputs and generation forecasts
   - **Battery Management Agent**: Optimized storage operations considering degradation and efficiency

3. **Software Implementation**:
   - **Optimization Engine**: CBC solver via PuLP interface (solving time limit: 60 seconds per 24-hour horizon)
   - **Machine Learning Framework**: Scikit-learn for behavioral pattern modeling
   - **Data Pipeline**: Pandas and NumPy for data processing and management
   - **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for hyperparameter tracking and result logging

4. **Computational Environment**:
   - **Hardware**: Intel Xeon E5-2680v4 CPU, 64 GB RAM
   - **Performance Metrics**: Average optimization solving time of 8.2 seconds per building per day
   - **Parallelization**: Building-level parallel processing with shared weather and price inputs

#### 4.2.4 Additional Mathematical Models

#### 4.2.4.1 User Preference Modeling

User preference for device operation is modeled with a time-dependent penalty function:

$$\text{PP}_d(t) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t \in \text{preferred hours} \\\n1 - P_d(t) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $P_d(t)$ is the learned probability of device $d$ operating at hour $t$. For devices with learned usage patterns, we define preferred hours as those with probability exceeding a threshold $\theta$:

$$\text{preferred hours}_d = \{h | P_d(h) > \theta\}$$

With $\theta = 0.05$ set as our operating threshold for scheduling decisions.

#### 4.2.4.2 Battery Value Function

The battery value function considers both immediate arbitrage value and degradation costs:

$$V(b^{ch}, b^{dis}) = \sum_{t=1}^{24} p_t \cdot (b_t^{dis} - b_t^{ch}) - \gamma \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{24} (b_t^{ch} + b_t^{dis})$$

Where $\gamma$ is the degradation cost coefficient (0.045 €/kWh).

#### 4.2.4.3 Uncertainty Modeling

Forecast uncertainty is modeled using scenario-based robust optimization:

$$\varepsilon_t = \max_{s \in S} |\hat{f}_t - f_t^s|$$

**Where:**

- $\hat{f}_t$ is the nominal forecast value at time $t$
- $f_t^s$ is the forecast value in scenario $s$ at time $t$
- $S$ is the set of considered scenarios

This uncertainty buffer is incorporated with a penalty weight $\mu$ that varies based on the criticality of the decision point. -->

<p><em>Figure 3: Load Profile Comparison (Building 3, Winter Weekday)</em></p>
<p>The optimization successfully shifted flexible loads away from the evening peak price period (hours 17-21) to lower-price periods (hours 0-3 and 10-15). This shift not only reduced energy costs but also contributed to grid stability by reducing peak demand.</p>
<p>Across all buildings, peak demand reduction ranged from 15% to 35%, with the most significant reductions in buildings with higher flexible load penetration.</p>

<p>The MILP optimization solver demonstrated good scalability, with solve times ranging from 1.2 seconds for small problems to 18.7 seconds for large robust optimization problems with multiple scenarios. Memory usage remained within reasonable limits for all problem sizes, making the system suitable for deployment on standard computing hardware.</p>
<p>The robust optimization approach with multiple scenarios resulted in longer solve times but still remained practical for day-ahead scheduling applications. For real-time rescheduling, simplified models with fewer scenarios were used to maintain acceptable response times.</p>
<h4>4.3.10 System Adaptation to Changes</h4>
<p>We evaluated the system's ability to adapt to changes in user behavior and environmental conditions by introducing several synthetic changes and monitoring the response:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vacation Periods</strong>: Simulated 7-day absences for each household</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal Transitions</strong>: Analyzed behavior during spring-to-summer and fall-to-winter transitions</li>
<li><strong>Device Replacements</strong>: Simulated the replacement of existing devices with new ones having different operating characteristics</li>
</ol>
<p>The system demonstrated strong adaptive capabilities, with probability models adjusting to new patterns within 5-10 days for major changes and 2-3 days for minor changes. The adaptive learning rates automatically adjusted based on detected pattern changes, accelerating learning when necessary.</p>
<h4>4.3.11 Summary of Key Results</h4>
<p>The evaluation demonstrated that the EMS achieved its primary objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Consistent reductions in energy costs across all buildings and scenarios (12-38%)</li>
<li><strong>User Satisfaction</strong>: High preference satisfaction rates (&gt;85%) when accounting for user preferences</li>
<li><strong>DER Integration</strong>: Effective integration of PV and battery systems, with PV self-consumption increasing from 42% to 87%</li>
<li><strong>Prediction Accuracy</strong>: High-performance machine learning models with AUC scores of 0.83-0.94</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Effective learning and adaptation to changing conditions within 5-10 days</li>
<li><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: Practical solve times (1-20 seconds) for all problem sizes</li>
</ol>
<p>These results validate the effectiveness of the probabilistic optimization approach and demonstrate its practical applicability for real-world energy management scenarios.</p>
<h3>4.4 Discussion and Insights</h3>
<p>The evaluation of our Energy Management System reveals several important insights into the integration of probabilistic machine learning approaches with optimization techniques for energy management. This section discusses the key findings, implications, and limitations of our work.</p>
<h4>4.4.1 Key Findings</h4>
<h5>Effectiveness of Probabilistic Approach</h5>
<p>The integration of probability mass functions (PMFs) into the MILP optimization framework proved highly effective for balancing cost minimization with user preferences. By representing device usage patterns as probabilities rather than binary constraints, the system gained significant flexibility in scheduling while maintaining high user satisfaction rates.</p>
<p>Importantly, this approach addressed a key limitation of traditional rule-based or deterministic optimization approaches, which often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user behavior and device usage patterns. The probabilistic approach allowed the system to adapt to different user behaviors without requiring explicit programming of rules or constraints.</p>
<h5>Impact of Learning on Optimization Performance</h5>
<p>The continuous learning mechanism demonstrated clear benefits for optimization performance. As the system learned more accurate probability distributions, the quality of the generated schedules improved in terms of both cost savings and user satisfaction. The convergence analysis showed that most devices reached stable probability distributions within 15-20 days, at which point the optimization results also stabilized.</p>
<p>This finding highlights the importance of the learning component in real-world energy management systems. Static optimization approaches that do not adapt to changing user behaviors may perform well initially but deteriorate over time as patterns change. Our adaptive approach ensured sustained performance even as user behaviors evolved.</p>
<h5>Trade-offs Between Objectives</h5>
<p>The results clearly demonstrated the trade-offs between different optimization objectives. When focusing solely on cost minimization, the system achieved higher cost savings but at the expense of user preference satisfaction. Conversely, when prioritizing user preferences, the cost savings were reduced but remained significant.</p>
<p>This trade-off can be quantified: for every 10% increase in user preference weight, cost savings decreased by approximately 2-3%. However, even with high user preference weights, the system still achieved substantial cost savings (12-26%) compared to unoptimized operation. This demonstrates that cost-effective energy management is compatible with user comfort when implemented through intelligent scheduling.</p>
<h5>Value of DER Integration</h5>
<p>The integration of PV systems and batteries significantly amplified the benefits of intelligent scheduling. Buildings with PV and battery systems achieved 10-15% higher cost savings compared to buildings with only flexible loads. This synergistic effect occurred because the optimization could coordinate flexible loads with PV generation and battery operation to maximize value.</p>
<p>This finding has important implications for energy policy and incentives. The results suggest that incentives for combined investments in flexible devices, PV systems, and batteries would yield greater benefits than separate incentives for each technology.</p>
<h4>4.4.2 Engineering Challenges</h4>
<p>Despite the positive results, our system faced several limitations and challenges that warrant discussion:</p>
<h5>Initial Learning Period</h5>
<p>The system required a learning period (15-20 days on average) before reaching optimal performance. During this initial period, the probability distributions were less accurate, leading to suboptimal schedules. This "cold start" problem is inherent to learning-based systems and represents a practical deployment challenge.</p>
<p>Potential solutions include using transfer learning from similar households to bootstrap the initial models or implementing a hybrid approach that uses rule-based scheduling during the initial learning period.</p>
<h5>Handling Rare Events</h5>
<p>The current implementation struggled to accurately predict and accommodate rare usage events, such as occasional use of specific devices or unusual usage patterns during holidays. These rare events were often not captured well in the probability distributions, leading to reduced user satisfaction in these specific cases.</p>
<p>Future work could address this limitation by incorporating additional features that help identify potential rare events, such as calendar data or explicit user inputs about upcoming changes in routine.</p>
<h5>Computational Complexity for Large-Scale Deployment</h5>
<p>While the optimization solver demonstrated good performance for individual buildings, scaling to hundreds or thousands of buildings would require additional architectural considerations. The current implementation is not optimized for large-scale deployment, particularly for the robust optimization approach with multiple scenarios.</p>
<p>Distributed optimization approaches or hierarchical control architectures would be necessary for large-scale deployments, potentially at the expense of global optimality.</p>
<h5>Privacy and Data Security Concerns</h5>
<p>The system relies on detailed energy consumption data at the device level, which raises privacy concerns. While our implementation anonymized all data for research purposes, real-world deployments would need to address these concerns through appropriate data minimization, anonymization, and secure storage practices.</p>
<h3>4.5 Comparison with Related Work</h3>
<p>Compared to existing approaches in the literature, our system offers several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Compared to Rule-Based Systems</strong>: Our approach eliminates the need for manual rule specification and can adapt to changing conditions without reprogramming. Rule-based systems like those described by Chen et al. (2022) achieve 10-15% cost savings but lack adaptability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compared to Reinforcement Learning Approaches</strong>: Our hybrid approach combines the interpretability of MILP optimization with the adaptability of learning-based methods. Pure RL approaches like those in Li et al. (2024) achieve similar cost savings (15-30%) but require longer training periods and offer less transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compared to Deterministic Optimization</strong>: Our probabilistic approach better handles uncertainty and user preferences compared to deterministic MILP formulations like Kanakadhurga &amp; Prabaharan (2024), which achieve comparable cost savings but lower user satisfaction rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compared to Price-Based Control</strong>: Direct price-based control methods like those in Vrettos et al. (2021) achieve lower cost savings (8-15%) and offer less flexibility in balancing multiple objectives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.6 Practical Implementation Considerations</h3>
<p>The results of our study have several practical implications for the deployment of energy management systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tailored Solutions</strong>: Different building types benefit from different optimization approaches. Commercial buildings with more predictable loads benefit most from cost optimization, while residential buildings require careful balancing of cost and preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progressive Implementation</strong>: Deployment could follow a staged approach, starting with basic scheduling and progressively adding features like PV integration, battery control, and robust optimization as users become familiar with the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Interface Considerations</strong>: The system should provide transparent explanations of scheduling decisions and allow users to override schedules when needed, building trust in the automated system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with Existing Systems</strong>: For practical adoption, the EMS needs to integrate with existing building management systems and smart home platforms, requiring standardized APIs and communication protocols.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>For Grid Operators</strong>: In line with findings by Bradac et al. (2014), our system's ability to shift 15-35% of flexible loads away from peak periods continues the advancement of solutions that contribute to grid stability and infrastructure utilization. At scale, such approaches could help reduce the need for peaking power plants and transmission upgrades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Policymakers and Regulators</strong>: Our findings provide evidence-based support for integrated energy policies that consider the synergistic effects of coordinated DER management. The demonstrable benefits of combining flexible loads, renewable generation, and storage systems suggest policy frameworks should incentivize integrated approaches rather than single-technology solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Technology Providers and Integrators</strong>: The open architecture and well-defined interfaces create opportunities for ecosystem development around core EMS capabilities. Hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers can leverage the platform to create complementary offerings that enhance overall value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>5.3 Future Horizon</h4>
<p>As energy systems worldwide continue to evolve toward greater renewable penetration, dynamic pricing, and decentralization, the need for intelligent energy management will only grow. Our work demonstrates that by combining the strengths of machine learning for prediction and adaptation with the power of optimization for decision-making, effective solutions can be developed that balance multiple competing objectives.</p>
<p>The field of energy management sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines, including data science, operations research, power systems engineering, and human-computer interaction. Our interdisciplinary approach highlights the importance of integrating insights from these various fields to create systems that are not only technically sound but also practical and user-centered.</p>
<p>Looking forward, this system establishes a foundation for emerging applications including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Energy Management</strong>: Extending beyond individual buildings to coordinate energy flows across neighborhoods and microgrids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grid Service Integration</strong>: Enabling buildings to participate in grid markets for frequency regulation, congestion management, and virtual power plant operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Carbon-Intelligent Scheduling</strong>: Optimizing not just for cost but for carbon intensity, helping organizations meet increasingly stringent sustainability commitments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience Enhancement</strong>: Integrating with outage management systems to provide critical load support during grid disruptions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These capabilities position the EMS as a critical enabling technology for the ongoing energy transition, delivering immediate value while providing a platform for continuous innovation in the rapidly evolving energy landscape.</p>
<h3>6. Future Work</h3>
<h4>6.1 Future Directions</h4>
<p>Based on our findings and identified limitations, we propose several promising directions for future research and development:</p>
<h4>6.2 Near-Term Quick Wins</h4>
<p>Two high-impact enhancements scheduled as next-sprint deliverables:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-Time Pricing API Integration</strong> [next-sprint deliverable]: Direct connection to utility pricing APIs would eliminate manual price data entry and enable immediate response to dynamic pricing signals. This enhancement requires minimal architectural changes while providing immediate operational benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Deployment on ARM</strong> [next-sprint deliverable]: Optimizing the system for deployment on ARM-based edge devices to enable local processing, reduce latency, and enhance privacy by keeping sensitive data on-premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile User Interface</strong>: A simple mobile app allowing users to view schedules and override device operations would significantly improve user acceptance and trust. Basic notification capabilities for high-savings opportunities could further enhance engagement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>6.3 Enhanced Learning and Prediction Models</h4>
<h5>Multi-Modal Learning</h5>
<p>Future work could explore the integration of multiple data sources beyond energy consumption, such as occupancy detection, weather conditions, and calendar information. This multi-modal approach could improve prediction accuracy and better capture the context behind user behaviors.</p>
<p>Specifically, incorporating data from smart home sensors (motion, temperature, etc.) could provide additional context for device usage prediction. For example, correlating cooking activities with kitchen occupancy or linking laundry patterns to bedroom activity could enhance the accuracy of usage predictions.</p>
<h5>Transfer Learning for Cold Start Mitigation</h5>
<p>To address the cold start problem, future research could investigate transfer learning techniques that leverage models trained on similar households to bootstrap new installations. This approach could significantly reduce the initial learning period and improve out-of-the-box performance.</p>
<p>A promising direction would be to develop a taxonomy of household types based on size, composition, and general behavior patterns, with pre-trained models for each category that can be fine-tuned with limited data from new households.</p>
<h5>Explainable AI Integration</h5>
<p>Integrating explainable AI techniques would enhance user trust and system adoption. Future versions could provide natural language explanations for scheduling decisions, helping users understand why specific schedules were chosen and how they can adjust their preferences to better align with cost-saving opportunities.</p>
<p>Visualization tools that illustrate the relationship between predicted usage patterns, energy prices, and scheduled operations would further enhance user understanding and acceptance.</p>
<h4>6.4 Optimization Techniques</h4>
<h5>Distributed and Hierarchical Optimization</h5>
<p>For large-scale deployments, future work could explore distributed optimization techniques that coordinate multiple buildings while respecting privacy constraints. Hierarchical approaches that combine local optimization at the building level with coordination at the neighborhood or grid level could enable scalable implementations.</p>
<p>Agent-based approaches where each building optimizes locally but shares limited information with a coordinator could achieve near-optimal results while preserving privacy and reducing computational complexity.</p>
<h5>Online and Adaptive Optimization</h5>
<p>Real-time adaptation to unexpected events (e.g., sudden price changes, device failures) represents an important direction for future work. Combining day-ahead scheduling with real-time adjustments through model predictive control could enhance system resilience and performance.</p>
<p>The development of fast re-optimization algorithms that can quickly adjust schedules in response to new information would be particularly valuable for practical implementations.</p>
<h5>Multi-Objective Optimization Enhancements</h5>
<p>Future research could expand the multi-objective framework to include additional objectives beyond cost and user preferences, such as carbon emissions, grid support services, and resilience metrics. This would enable optimization that aligns with broader sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Pareto optimization approaches that explicitly characterize the trade-offs between different objectives would provide valuable insights for users and policymakers.</p>
<h4>6.5 System Extensions and Applications</h4>
<h5>Integration with Building-to-Grid Services</h5>
<p>Extending the system to provide grid services such as demand response, frequency regulation, and congestion management represents a promising direction. This would require the development of interfaces with grid operators and market platforms, as well as the incorporation of additional constraints and objectives in the optimization framework.</p>
<p>The economic potential of providing such services could significantly enhance the value proposition of the EMS, particularly for buildings with large flexible loads and storage capabilities.</p>
<h5>EV-Specific Extensions</h5>
<p>Given the growing importance of electric vehicles, future work could focus on specialized EV charging optimization that accounts for mobility patterns, battery degradation, and vehicle-to-grid capabilities. This would require the development of specific prediction models for EV availability and energy requirements.</p>
<p>Integrating mobility prediction with charging optimization could unlock significant value, particularly for fleet applications or shared mobility services.</p>
<h5>Community Energy Management</h5>
<p>Expanding the system to optimize energy use across communities or microgrids represents a natural extension. This would involve the development of mechanisms for fair allocation of costs and benefits, as well as protocols for energy sharing and trading between buildings.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer energy trading frameworks that leverage the prediction and optimization capabilities of our system could enable more efficient local energy markets and enhance the value of distributed energy resources.</p>
<h4>6.6 Implementation and Deployment Enhancements</h4>
<h5>Edge Computing Integration</h5>
<p>Future implementations could leverage edge computing architectures to enhance privacy, reduce latency, and improve resilience. Running the prediction models and optimization algorithms on local hardware would reduce dependence on cloud connectivity and enhance data privacy.</p>
<p>Federated learning approaches could enable model improvement without centralizing sensitive data, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining learning capabilities.</p>
<h5>Standardized APIs and Integration Frameworks</h5>
<p>Developing standardized APIs and integration frameworks would facilitate interoperability with various building management systems, smart home platforms, and energy market interfaces. This would reduce implementation costs and accelerate adoption across different environments.</p>
<p>Open-source reference implementations of key components would foster innovation and customization for specific applications and markets.</p>
<h4>6.7 User Interface and Experience Enhancements</h4>
<p>User interfaces that provide intuitive visualization of energy flows, costs, and schedules would enhance user engagement and trust. Incorporating user feedback mechanisms that allow users to refine the system's understanding of their preferences would improve personalization over time.</p>
<p>Mobile applications with notification systems for important events (e.g., schedule changes, unexpected price changes) would enhance the user experience and encourage active participation.</p>

<h2>Appendix B: Mathematical Formulations</h2>
<p>This appendix provides detailed mathematical formulations for the key components of the Energy Management System.</p>
<h3>Appendix B: MILP Formulation</h3>
<p>The complete mathematical formulation of the MILP optimization problem is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Objective Function:</strong></p>
<p>$$\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[ p_t \cdot \left( \sum_{d \in D} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b_t^+ - b_t^- - s_t \right) + p^{\text{degradation}} \cdot (b_t^+ + b_t^-) + \sum_{d \in D} w_{\text{prob},d} \cdot (1 - P_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t}) \right]$$</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$p_t$ electricity price at time $t$  </li>
<li>$c_{d,t}$ consumption of device $d$ at time $t$  </li>
<li>$x_{d,t}$ binary decision for device $d$ at time $t$  </li>
<li>$b_t^{+}$ battery <strong>charge</strong> power at time $t$  </li>
<li>$b_t^{-}$ battery <strong>discharge</strong> power at time $t$  </li>
<li>$s_t$ PV generation at time $t$  </li>
<li>$p_{\text{deg}}$ battery-degradation cost  </li>
<li>$w_{d}^{\text{prob}}$ probability weight for device $d$  </li>
<li>$P_{d,t}$ probability that device $d$ is used at time $t$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device Constraints:</strong></p>
<p>For flexible devices with fixed runtime $r_d$:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} y_{d,t} = 1$$
$$x_{d,t} = \sum_{\tau=\max (0,t-r_d+1)}^t y_{d,\tau} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$</p>
<p>where $y_{d,t}$ is a binary variable indicating if device $d$ starts at time $t$.</p>
<p>For semi-flexible devices with energy requirement $E_d$:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} = E_d$$</p>
<p>For partial-usage devices (e.g., EV chargers):
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} e_{d,t} = E_{d,\text{req}}$$
$$e_{d,t} \leq P_{d,\max} \cdot x_{d,t} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$</p>
<p>where $e_{d,t}$ is the energy consumed by device $d$ at time $t$ and $E_{d,\text{req}}$ is the total energy requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Constraints:</strong></p>
<p>$$SOC_{t+1} = SOC_t + \eta^+ \cdot b_t^+ - \frac{b_t^-}{\eta^-} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-2}$$
$$SOC_T = SOC_{\text{target}}$$
$$SOC_{\min} \leq SOC_t \leq SOC_{\max} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$
$$0 \leq b_t^+ \leq P_{\max} \cdot z_t^+ \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$
$$0 \leq b_t^- \leq P_{\max} \cdot z_t^- \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$
$$z_t^+ + z_t^- \leq 1 \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$</p>
<p>where $SOC_t$ is the battery state of charge at time $t$, $\eta^+$ and $\eta^-$ are charging and discharging efficiencies, $z_t^+$ and $z_t^-$ are binary variables indicating charging and discharging states.</p>
<p><strong>Grid Constraints:</strong></p>
<p>$$g_t^+ = \sum_{d \in D} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b_t^+ - b_t^- - s_t \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$
$$0 \leq g_t^+ \leq G_{\max} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$
$$0 \leq g_t^- \leq G_{\max}^{-} \quad \forall t \in {0,1,\ldots ,T-1}$$</p>
<p>where $g_t^+$ is the power imported from the grid at time $t$, $g_t^-$ is the power exported to the grid, and $G_{\max}$ and $G_{\max}^{-}$ are the maximum import and export capacities.</p>
<h4>B.2. Probability Model Update Equations</h4>
<p>The probability update mechanism follows a Bayesian-inspired approach:</p>
<p>$$P_{d,t}^{\text{new}} = P_{d,t}^{\text{old}} + \alpha \cdot (L_{d,t} - P_{d,t}^{\text{old}})$$</p>
<p>where $P_{d,t}^{\text{old}}$ is the prior probability, $L_{d,t}$ is the likelihood (1 if device was used, 0 otherwise), and $\alpha$ is the adaptive learning rate given by:</p>
<p>$$\alpha = \max \left(\alpha_{\min}, \min \left(\alpha_{\max}, \alpha_0 \cdot \gamma^n\right)\right)$$</p>
<p>where $\alpha_0$ is the initial learning rate, $\gamma$ is the decay factor, $n$ is the number of updates, and $\alpha_{\min}$ and $\alpha_{\max}$ are the minimum and maximum learning rates.</p>
<p>For unexpected usage patterns (usage at times with low probability):</p>
<p>$$\alpha = \min \left(\alpha_{\max}, \alpha_0 \cdot \gamma^n \cdot 2\right)$$</p>

<h4>C.3. Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
<p>Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of key parameters on system performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Rate Impact</strong>: Varying the learning rate between 0.05 and 0.3 showed that higher learning rates led to faster convergence but potentially less stable probability distributions. The optimal range was found to be 0.1-0.15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price Forecast Error</strong>: The system maintained 80% of its cost savings even with price forecast errors of up to 20%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Preference Weight</strong>: For every 0.1 increase in user preference weight, cost savings decreased by approximately 2-3%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Battery Capacity</strong>: Doubling battery capacity from 5kWh to 10kWh increased cost savings by 7-9% for buildings with PV systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>E.4. Production Standards and Compliance</h4>
<p><strong>NO FALLBACKS Policy</strong>: The system implements strict agent-based architecture with zero tolerance for fallback mechanisms. All optimization must use the centralized <code>optimize_phases_centralized()</code> method to ensure consistent, predictable behavior across deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Production Compliance Requirements</strong>:
- All agents must implement required interface methods
- No legacy optimization methods permitted in production
- Comprehensive test coverage with <code>test_no_fallback.py</code> enforcement
- Memory usage monitoring with &lt;4GB operational limits
- Jensen-Shannon divergence tracking for model convergence validation </p>
