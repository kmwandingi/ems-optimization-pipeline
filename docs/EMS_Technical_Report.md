## 1. Management Introduction

Rising energy costs and grid complexity create substantial challenges for building operators. Energy prices fluctuate frequently, renewable integration introduces intermittency, and buildings lack automated systems to optimize multiple energy-consuming devices. This results in missed cost-saving opportunities and exposure to price volatility.

Our Energy Management System automatically manages building energy use by learning device usage patterns and scheduling operations when electricity prices are lowest while respecting user preferences. Back-testing on six buildings demonstrated consistent 10-30% cost reductions across different building types and energy configurations.

Conservative analysis shows 8-12% annual savings in worst-case scenarios, with optimal implementations achieving 30-45% improvements in net present value. The system pays for itself within 12-18 months while providing sustained operational returns. Technical implementation details are described in Section 3.

## 2. Project Context

### 2.1 Project Background

The modern energy landscape is undergoing rapid transformation driven by increased renewable energy integration, dynamic electricity pricing, and rising consumption complexity. In smart grids—such as those emerging in the Netherlands—electricity prices fluctuate frequently, offering substantial opportunities for cost optimization through demand response and load shifting. However, many buildings lack automated energy management capabilities, leaving households and commercial users unable to fully exploit potential cost savings.

Simultaneously, as renewable energy sources like solar and wind become prevalent, grid stability challenges emerge due to intermittent generation patterns. This intermittency increases grid congestion risks, particularly during peak periods, and necessitates more demand-side management strategies to ensure reliability.

Furthermore, energy costs continue to rise globally, influenced by factors such as fossil fuel price volatility, regulatory changes, and infrastructure investments required for renewable integration. For end-users, especially households and small commercial entities, the complexity of managing multiple energy-consuming devices (e.g., electric vehicles, heating systems, washing machines, and dishwashers) further exacerbates the challenge of efficient energy use.

This project was initiated through Ilustre Lab—a living lab formed through collaboration between JADS (Jheronimus Academy of Data Science, a partnership between Tilburg University and TU/e), LaNubia Consulting, and ROBUST—to develop AI-driven solutions for energy management across diverse environments. Ilustre Lab plays a central role in bridging academic research with real-world applications, ensuring that the EMS project aligns with industry needs and facilitates a smooth transfer of technology to practical deployments, particularly in the Caribbean context.

The project employs a **dual-track approach**:
1. **Dutch Context**: Prototyped in an environment with day-ahead pricing, smart metering, and flexible demand-response capabilities
2. **Curaçao Context**: Designed for future adaptation to Caribbean island settings where current pricing is monthly and smart infrastructure is still developing

In contrast, Curaçao currently employs monthly electricity pricing, but faces distinct challenges:

- **Renewable Transition**: Curaçao's National Energy Policy aims for higher renewable penetration, introducing intermittent generation that requires more dynamic demand-side flexibility to ensure grid reliability
- **Energy Poverty**: Many households experience difficulty affording electricity, causing financial hardship and disconnections. This amplifies the importance of cost-effective energy management
- **Isolated Grid System**: As an island, Curaçao operates an isolated power grid that, although very stable, is more vulnerable should the grid fail.

By combining mathematical optimization with practical energy management strategies, the EMS provides solutions for:
- Reducing energy costs through intelligent load shifting
- Supporting grid stability by smoothing consumption patterns
- Integrating renewable energy sources more effectively
- Mitigating energy poverty through improved consumption management

Throughout the project, our strategy evolved in a series of deliberate, sequential steps that integrated rigorous data science methodologies with a holistic understanding of the energy management challenges faced at both the device level and the grid level. Key phases included problem identification and refinement, contextualization, comprehensive literature review, formulation of research questions, design of research methodology, framework selection, ethical considerations, and planning for future enhancements.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Against the backdrop of transforming energy landscapes, our project aims to bridge the efficiency gap between current consumption patterns and the potential for flexible, optimized energy use. The central research problem is framed as:

"How can we design a modular EMS that leverages MILP-based scheduling to optimize household energy consumption under dynamic pricing—integrating optional DERs (PV, battery) and grid constraints—in a way that is effective in the Dutch context and readily adaptable for the evolving Curaçao market?"

We identified that the "energy efficiency gap"—where households consume energy inefficiently due to behavioral inertia and a lack of automated control—has received considerable attention in the literature. Several notable studies, such as Henggeler Antunes et al. (2022), Bradac et al. (2014), and Gerards et al. (2015), have developed modular and holistic MILP-based optimization frameworks that can accommodate a range of flexible and inflexible devices within residential or commercial buildings. These works have shown the feasibility and value of unified, whole-building optimization strategies—moving beyond purely device-specific or rule-based methods. However, challenges remain in areas such as real-time adaptability, seamless integration with probabilistic user behavior models, and continuous online learning from operational feedback. Our work builds on this foundation by embedding machine-learned probabilistic device usage patterns as soft constraints in the MILP, incorporating scenario-based uncertainty modeling, and implementing a closed-loop Bayesian update cycle to refine device behavior models over time.

### 2.3 Goal Specification and Added Value

#### For Future Expansion
- The design supports scalability, ensuring that the system can adapt as more smart infrastructure (e.g., smart meters and dynamic pricing) becomes available, particularly in emerging markets like Curaçao

### 2.4 Literature Review

The development of our Energy Management System builds upon several key research areas, including home energy management systems (HEMS), probabilistic optimization under uncertainty, and machine learning for energy usage prediction. This section provides a critical analysis of relevant literature that informed our technical approach.

### Home Energy Management Systems

The field of home energy management has evolved significantly over the past decade. Shareef et al. (2018) presented a review of HEMS technologies, highlighting the importance of integrating IoT devices with optimization algorithms to achieve effective energy management. Their work emphasized that while rule-based systems were common, they often failed to adapt to changing user behaviors and dynamic pricing environments.

Building on this foundation, Balakrishnan & Geetha (2021) categorized HEMS implementations into rule-based, optimization-based, and hybrid approaches. Their analysis revealed that hybrid approaches combining classical optimization with learning components showed the most promise for real-world deployments. However, they noted that many systems still relied on theoretical user models rather than data-driven approaches.

Vrettos et al. (2013) demonstrated the value of small-scale batteries and flexible thermal loads in maximizing local PV utilization, establishing a baseline for integrating battery operations with load scheduling. Their work, however, did not account for probabilistic user behavior patterns, which we address in our approach.

Setlhaolo et al. (2014) specifically tackled the problem of household appliance scheduling for demand response using MILP formulations. While effective for deterministic scenarios, their approach lacked mechanisms to handle user preference uncertainty—a gap our system specifically addresses through probabilistic modeling.

### Probabilistic Optimization and Uncertainty Handling

Among various approaches in the literature, Antunes et al. (2022) explored probabilistic and scenario-based optimization for home energy management under user behavior uncertainty. Their approach of modeling user behavior as probability distributions rather than deterministic patterns provided useful insights for our methodology. However, their system relied on pre-defined distributions rather than learning them from historical data.

Kanakadhurga & Prabaharan (2024) presented a scenario-based robust MILP approach specifically designed for smart home energy management that integrates PV, battery, and EV under uncertainty. Their work validated the effectiveness of scenario sampling for handling uncertainty in renewable generation and demonstrated practical cost savings. Our approach extends this concept by integrating learned device usage patterns directly into the optimization framework.

Li et al. (2024) explored data-driven approaches for battery management in residential energy systems, comparing model predictive control with reinforcement learning methods. Their work validated the importance of adaptability in battery management strategies, which we incorporate into our battery agent implementation.

### Machine Learning for Energy Prediction and Optimization

Recent advancements in applying machine learning to energy forecasting have shown promising results. Neumann & Hahn (2024) demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for short-term energy forecasting in smart homes. While their work focused on aggregate consumption forecasting, we extend similar concepts to device-level usage prediction.

Zafar et al. (2023) provided a review of reinforcement learning methods for household energy management, highlighting the importance of continuous learning and adaptation. Their analysis of various RL approaches informed our continuous learning pipeline design, although we opted for a more interpretable gradient-boosted tree approach rather than deep reinforcement learning.

Wei et al. (2020) presented a MILP-based optimal power management system for residential buildings with plug-in electric vehicles. Their mathematical formulation for EV charging optimization served as a reference for our partial-usage device model, though we simplified certain aspects based on findings from Antunes et al.

Blanc-Rouchosse et al. (2019) explored multi-agent coordination for demand response using smart IoT devices, proposing an architecture that influenced our agent-based system design. However, their coordination approach relied on centralized control, whereas our system balances centralized optimization with decentralized device-specific logic.

### Areas for Further Advancement in Existing Research

While previous works (such as those by Antunes et al., 2022; Bradac et al., 2014; Gerards et al., 2015) have made significant progress in MILP-based energy management and whole-building optimization, our literature review identified several areas where further advancements could be beneficial:

1. **Enhanced Integration of Learned Behavior Patterns**: While some existing systems incorporate user preferences, many still rely on fixed rules or theoretical user models rather than systematically learning actual usage patterns from historical data. Antunes et al. (2022) began addressing this with probability distributions, which we extend with machine learning techniques.

2. **Tighter Probabilistic-MILP Integration**: Although both probabilistic modeling and MILP optimization have been studied extensively (with notable work by Bradac et al., 2014 on MILP formulations), opportunities remain for tighter integration of these approaches within unified frameworks.

3. **Adaptive Continuous Learning**: Building on static optimization approaches, we identify opportunities to create systems that continuously adapt to changing user behaviors over time through closed-loop feedback mechanisms.

4. **Practical Implementation Considerations**: Academic research (including Gerards et al., 2015) has established strong theoretical foundations, which we extend by addressing practical deployment considerations like MLflow integration and scalable architecture.

5. **Cross-Market Adaptability**: Extending market-specific solutions, our approach considers adaptability to diverse pricing environments, from developed markets to evolving contexts like Curaçao.

Our Energy Management System builds upon these existing foundations by combining probabilistic device usage modeling with robust MILP optimization in a continuously learning framework, addressing these areas for advancement.

## 3. System Design

4. **Security and Privacy**: Protect user data and energy consumption patterns while enabling beneficial analytics.

### 3.3 Methodology

This section details our technical approach to developing the Energy Management System, focusing on the integration of probabilistic device usage modeling with MILP optimization. Our methodology employs a five-stage pipeline that processes historical data, learns user behavior patterns, optimizes device schedules, handles uncertainty, and continuously improves through feedback.

#### 3.3.1 Data Preprocessing and Analysis

The first stage of our pipeline involves collecting, cleaning, and processing energy consumption data to prepare it for subsequent machine learning and optimization steps.

#### Data Sources and Collection

Our system works with two primary types of data:

1. **Building-level Energy Data**: Collected via smart meters, this includes aggregate consumption and, where available, grid import/export measurements.

2. **Device-level Consumption Data**: Gathered through IoT devices or sub-metering systems, this provides granular insights into individual appliance usage patterns.

For development and testing, we primarily utilized the CoSSMic Project dataset:

- **CoSSMic Project Data**: Energy data from 11 buildings (residential, industrial, and public) in Konstanz, Germany, collected at 1-minute resolution. The dataset includes detailed measurements of grid import/export, PV generation, and individual appliance consumption (dishwashers, freezers, heat pumps, washing machines, etc.). The data was accessed through the Open Power System Data platform (https://data.open-power-system-data.org/household_data/).
- **UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity)**: A publicly available dataset containing device-level electricity consumption from UK households, which we processed to focus on schedulable devices.

#### Data Cleaning and Standardization

Our data preprocessing pipeline handles data cleaning and standardization with the following steps:

1. **Time Series Alignment**: Ensuring all timestamps are standardized to consistent intervals (typically hourly for optimization, with sub-hourly data aggregated appropriately).

2. **Missing Value Handling**: The CoSSMic dataset already includes an 'interpolated' column that indicates which values were missing in the source data. In our preprocessing pipeline, we specifically:
   - Apply pandas' forward-fill (`ffill`) method for short gaps
   - Create validity flags to mark periods with excessive missing data (>24 consecutive hours) for exclusion from training
   - Maintain a log of gap locations and durations for data quality assessment

3. **Outlier Detection and Correction**: Implemented a statistical approach using:
   - IQR (Interquartile Range) method: Values beyond Q3 + 1.5*IQR or below Q1 - 1.5*IQR were flagged
   - For appliances, values exceeding device-specific thresholds (e.g., >5kWh for a single hour for residential dishwashers) were capped

4. **Device Classification**: Categorizing devices based on their flexibility model for MILP optimization:
   - **Discrete Phase (`flex_model: "discrete_phase"`)**: Devices with fixed operating cycles that must run completely once started (e.g., dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, oven)
   - **Partial Usage (`flex_model: "partial_usage"`)**: Devices whose operation can be spread over time with flexible energy distribution (e.g., EV charging, water heater, heat pump)
   - **Continuous Consumption (`flex_model: "continuous"`)**: Devices with ongoing operation that can be modulated within constraints (e.g., refrigerator, freezer)
   - **Non-flexible (`flex_model: "none"`)**: Devices with fixed consumption patterns that cannot be shifted (grouped into "other_devices")

5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived features to enhance model performance, including:
   - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, weekend indicator)
   - Rolling statistical measures (7-day average usage)
   - Weather correlation features (temperature, solar radiation)
   - Device-specific metrics (time since last usage, peak usage ratio)

The data preparation process follows a systematic workflow that processes building energy data to create both daily and hourly feature sets. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Loading**: The system loads processed parquet files for each building, handling time zone conversions to ensure consistency.

2. **Feature Engineering - Daily Level**:
   - **Temporal Usage Patterns**: Rolling 7-day average usage statistics to capture weekly patterns
   - **Cyclical Time Features**: Previous day's peak usage hour (transformed using sine/cosine encoding)
   - **Binary Usage Indicators**: Target flags indicating whether a device was used that day (based on dynamic thresholds)
   - **Environmental Factors**: Weather data and PV forecast aggregates
   - **Calendar Features**: Day of week and weekend indicators

3. **Feature Engineering - Hourly Level**:
   - **Temporal Usage Patterns**: Cumulative usage statistics throughout the day and hourly energy consumption
   - **Cyclical Time Features**: Sine/cosine transformations of hour of day
   - **Binary Usage Indicators**: Flags for device operation in each hour
   - **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, solar radiation, and related weather data
   - **Calendar Features**: Hour of day, part of day (morning/afternoon/evening/night), weekday/weekend indicators

4. **Threshold Determination**: Dynamic thresholds are calculated for each device based on the distribution of positive usage values, allowing the system to adapt to different consumption patterns.

5. **Output Generation**: The process creates two structured datasets:
   - A daily dataframe for predicting whether a device will be used on a specific day
   - An hourly dataframe for modeling the distribution of usage across hours for days when the device is used

This comprehensive feature engineering approach enables the subsequent machine learning models to capture both macro patterns (which days devices are used) and micro patterns (which hours within those days).

#### CoSSMic Dataset Processing

We applied specific preprocessing steps to the CoSSMic dataset to prepare it for our modeling pipeline:

1. **Device Selection and Classification**: We identified and categorized the available devices in the CoSSMic dataset:
   - **Discrete Phase Devices**: Dishwashers (`DE_KN_residential1_dishwasher`, `DE_KN_residential2_dishwasher`, etc.), washing machines (`DE_KN_residential1_washing_machine`, etc.)
   - **Partial Usage Devices**: Heat pumps (`DE_KN_residential1_heat_pump`, `DE_KN_residential4_heat_pump`), EV chargers (`DE_KN_residential4_ev`, `DE_KN_industrial3_ev`)
   - **Continuous Devices**: Refrigerators (`DE_KN_residential3_refrigerator`, etc.), freezers (`DE_KN_residential1_freezer`, etc.)
   - **PV Generation**: Multiple PV sources across buildings (`DE_KN_residential1_pv`, `DE_KN_residential3_pv`, etc.)

2. **Temporal Resolution Standardization**: 
   - We used the 60-minute resolution dataset (`household_data_60min_singleindex.csv`) as our primary source
   - The timestamps were properly converted between UTC and CET/CEST using the provided dual timestamp columns

3. **Handling Interpolated Data**: 
   - The dataset includes an `interpolated` column that indicates which values were missing in the source data
   - We created validity flags to track periods with interpolated data for quality control

4. **Building-Specific Processing**:
   - For each building (e.g., `DE_KN_residential1`, `DE_KN_residential2`), we created separate parquet files
   - Grid import/export, device-level consumption, and PV generation were grouped by building

5. **Weather Data Integration**:
   - Weather data for Konstanz, Germany was matched to the dataset's timestamp resolution
   - Temperature, solar radiation, and other relevant weather parameters were aligned with the energy data

The UK-DALE dataset was processed using a similar approach for consistency, with device names standardized to match the CoSSMic naming conventions. Both datasets were then formatted into uniform parquet files for efficient access by the machine learning pipeline.

#### 3.3.2 Machine Learning for Device Usage Prediction

Building upon established approaches in the literature, this work employs a two-stage machine learning pipeline to derive probabilistic usage patterns from historical consumption data. This data-driven methodology facilitates the identification and adaptation to household-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enabling far more precise energy scheduling compared to static rule-based systems or theoretical usage models.

#### Two-Stage Prediction Framework

Our device usage prediction framework consists of two complementary models:

1. **Daily Usage Model (LightGBM)**: Predicts whether a device will be used on a given day
2. **Hourly Usage Model (CatBoost)**: For days when the device is predicted to be used, determines the probability distribution of usage across different hours

This two-stage approach allows us to accurately model both the temporal patterns of device usage (which days devices are used) and the time-of-day preferences (which hours within those days).

##### Daily Usage Prediction with LightGBM

For the daily prediction task, we implemented a LightGBM classifier with calibrated probabilities. This model determines the likelihood that a specific device will be used on a given day based on historical patterns and contextual features.

**Daily Model Training Process:**

The system trains daily device usage prediction models using LightGBM gradient boosting:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Temporal features (day of week, holidays), weather data, and rolling usage statistics are incorporated while excluding non-predictive variables.

2. **Model Training**: LightGBM uses optimized hyperparameters (see Appendix E.1) with binary cross-entropy loss and cross-building validation to ensure generalization to new environments.

3. **Performance**: Models achieve AUC scores of 0.78-0.88 across device types, with probability calibration ensuring accurate likelihood estimates for optimization.

Key features include weather patterns, temporal cycles, historical usage averages, and circular-encoded peak usage times.

##### Hourly Usage Prediction with CatBoost

For the hourly prediction task, we implemented a CatBoost classifier to model the probability distribution across different hours of the day. This model captures fine-grained temporal patterns and user preferences.

**Hourly Model Training Process:**

The system trains hourly usage prediction models using CatBoost gradient boosting:

1. **Feature Processing**: Categorical features (hour, day of week, weekend indicators) receive specialized encoding while excluding non-predictive variables.

2. **Model Training**: CatBoost uses optimized hyperparameters (see Appendix E.2) with log loss and cross-building validation ensuring generalization to unseen buildings.

3. **Performance**: Models achieve AUC scores of 0.75-0.85, effectively distinguishing usage vs idle hours across device types.

Key features include hour-of-day (raw and circular-encoded), day context, and weekend indicators.
- **Weather conditions**: Temperature, solar radiation at the specific hour
- **Usage context**: Cumulative usage earlier in the day, time since last usage
- **Relative usage patterns**: Peak usage ratio, previous hour state

CatBoost was selected for this task due to its strong performance with categorical features (hour of day, day of week) and its ability to handle the complex, non-linear relationships between these features and device usage patterns.

#### Probability Mass Function Generation

The outputs from both models are combined to create hour-by-hour Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) for each device. For a given device on a specific day:

1. The LightGBM model predicts the likelihood that the device will be used that day
2. If the probability exceeds a threshold, the CatBoost model determines how that usage is distributed across the 24 hours of the day
3. These hourly probabilities are normalized to form a valid PMF

The resulting PMF provides a complete picture of when the device is likely to be used, which is then integrated into the MILP optimization as soft constraints.

**Probability Mass Function Generation Process:**

The system generates comprehensive probability distributions for device usage through a multi-step process:

1. **Daily Usage Assessment**:
   - Device-specific and temporal features are extracted for the target day
   - The daily model evaluates these features to determine the overall likelihood of device usage
   - This step efficiently filters out days where device usage is highly improbable

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - A configurable daily probability threshold determines the subsequent processing flow
   - For days with below-threshold probability, a uniform low-probability distribution is applied
   - This approach prevents unnecessary computation while maintaining mathematical consistency

**Hourly Probability Generation Process:**

The system generates hourly probability distributions through a structured process:

1. **Feature Extraction**: For each hour, device-specific features are extracted from historical data, including time context, past usage patterns, and environmental factors

2. **Probability Calculation**: The trained model evaluates these features to generate a raw probability value for each hour of the day

3. **Probability Mass Function Formation**: These individual hour probabilities are aggregated and normalized to form a valid probability mass function (PMF) where all values sum to 1.0

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: To ensure robustness, the system implements fallback strategies such as:
   - For devices with insufficient data, returning a low-probability distribution
   - For cases where normalization fails, defaulting to a uniform distribution across all hours

This approach ensures that valid probability distributions are always available for the optimization process, even in edge cases or when dealing with new devices.

#### Continuous Learning with Adaptive PMFs

Beyond the initial model training, our system implements a continuous learning mechanism that updates device usage probabilities as new data becomes available. This is implemented in the `ProbabilityModelAgent` class, which maintains and updates PMFs for each device.

The adaptive PMF approach uses a Bayesian-inspired update mechanism with several key features:

1. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: The learning rate decreases as more observations are collected, but increases when the system detects significant changes in usage patterns

2. **Update Capping**: Updates are capped to prevent single observations from drastically changing the probability distribution

3. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence Tracking**: The system tracks the divergence between successive probability distributions to monitor convergence and detect pattern changes

4. **Weekend/Weekday Differentiation**: Different probability distributions are maintained for weekdays and weekends

**Probability Model Update Process:**

The system updates device probability distributions through a Bayesian-inspired approach that balances responsiveness with stability:

1. **Initialization Handling**: When updating a device for the first time, the system initializes its probability distribution using prior knowledge from similar devices, establishing a starting point for learning

2. **Update Management**: The system implements safeguards against redundant updates, such as preventing multiple updates for the same device on the same day when specified

3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Rather than using a fixed learning rate, the system calculates an adaptive rate based on:
   - The number of observations collected so far
   - The day type (weekday vs. weekend)
   - The stability of recent probability distributions
   - The time elapsed since previous updates

4. **Bounded Update Mechanism**: To prevent excessive changes from single observations:
   - Updates are capped proportionally to the calculated learning rate
   - Caps are adjusted based on the number of updates received on a given day
   - All probability values are constrained to remain non-negative

5. **Target-Based Adjustment**: For the observed usage hour, the probability is increased while probabilities for other hours are decreased, creating a guided learning approach

6. **Distribution Normalization**: After updates, the distribution is normalized to ensure it remains a valid probability mass function with values summing to 1.0

7. **Convergence Tracking**: The system monitors learning progress by calculating:
   - Jensen-Shannon divergence from the initial distribution
   - Incremental changes between successive distributions
   - Entropy measures to assess the concentration of probabilities

8. **Comprehensive Record Keeping**: Each update is logged with detailed metadata, creating a historical record that enables analysis of learning progression and potential drift detection

This update process ensures that device probability models continuously improve while remaining robust to outliers and noise in the observed data.

This continuous learning approach allows the system to adapt to changing user behaviors over time, ensuring that the optimization remains aligned with actual usage patterns even as these patterns evolve.

#### MLflow Model Tracking and Deployment

To ensure reproducibility and facilitate deployment, all models are tracked using MLflow. This allows us to version models, compare different training runs, and deploy the best-performing models to production.

**Model Logging and Registration Process:**

The system implements a comprehensive approach to model tracking and registration:

1. **Experiment Organization**:
   - Each training run is organized within MLflow's experiment tracking system
   - Device-specific naming conventions ensure clear categorization of model runs
   - This systematic approach enables easy filtering and comparison across different device types

2. **Parameter Documentation**:
   - Critical model parameters are automatically logged to ensure reproducibility
   - Device type and model architecture information is preserved for future reference
   - This metadata enables proper contextualization of model performance

3. **Performance Metrics Tracking**:
   - All relevant performance metrics are systematically recorded
   - Metrics typically include AUC, precision, recall, and other classification metrics
   - This comprehensive tracking enables performance comparison across model iterations

4. **Dual Model Registration**:
   - Both daily and hourly models are registered in the central model registry
   - Standardized naming conventions combine device type with model purpose
   - Proper artifact organization ensures all model files are correctly preserved
   - This structured approach facilitates streamlined deployment and version control

This integration with MLflow provides several benefits:

1. **Model Versioning**: Each training run creates a new version of the model, allowing us to track changes over time
2. **Performance Comparison**: Metrics from different training runs can be easily compared to identify the best-performing models
3. **Artifact Management**: Model files, along with associated metadata, are stored in a centralized location
4. **Deployment Automation**: Registered models can be easily deployed to production environments
5. **Reproducibility**: All parameters and data used for training are tracked, ensuring reproducibility

The PMFs generated by these models serve as a key input to the MILP optimization process, guiding the scheduling of devices to periods when they are most likely to be used while also considering electricity prices and other constraints.

#### 3.3.3 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Optimization

At the core of our Energy Management System is a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization framework that schedules device operations, battery charging/discharging, and PV utilization to minimize electricity costs while respecting both technical constraints and user preferences. The integration of probabilistic device usage patterns as soft constraints within the MILP formulation is central to our approach.

#### Optimization Framework Overview

Our optimization framework employs a hierarchical approach with three main components:

1. **Device-Level Optimization**: Each flexible device is modeled with specific operational constraints and optimization objectives
2. **Building-Level Coordination**: A global coordination layer ensures that all devices operate within the building's overall capacity constraints
3. **Probabilistic Integration**: The probability mass functions (PMFs) generated by the machine learning models are incorporated as soft constraints to guide device scheduling

This hierarchical structure allows the system to balance global optimization goals (minimizing total cost) with device-specific requirements (respecting operational constraints) and user preferences (aligning with likely usage patterns).

#### Device Categorization and Modeling

Our system classifies devices into categories based on their operational characteristics and flexibility, as defined in the device specifications:

1. **Discrete Phase Devices** (`flex_model: 'discrete_phase'`):
   - **Examples**: Dishwashers, washing machines, dryers
   - **Characteristics**: Operate in distinct phases with fixed power levels and durations
   - **Flexibility**: Can be scheduled within allowed hours but must complete all phases in sequence
   - **Implementation**: Modeled with phase-specific power requirements and temporal constraints

2. **Partial Usage Devices** (`flex_model: 'partial_usage'`):
   - **Examples**: EV chargers, heat pumps, circulation pumps
   - **Characteristics**: Can operate at variable times and be interrupted
   - **Flexibility**: Energy can be distributed flexibly within a time window
   - **Implementation**: Modeled with total energy requirements and flexible scheduling constraints

3. **Fixed Operation Devices** (`flex_model: 'fixed'`):
   - **Examples**: Refrigerators, freezers
   - **Characteristics**: Continuously operating with minimal flexibility
   - **Flexibility**: Limited to minor timing adjustments of duty cycles
   - **Implementation**: Modeled with baseline consumption patterns and tight operational constraints

4. **Always On Devices** (`category: 'Always On'`):
   - **Examples**: Lighting, network equipment
   - **Characteristics**: Must remain powered during specified hours
   - **Flexibility**: Minimal flexibility, primarily for emergency load shedding
   - **Implementation**: Modeled with fixed consumption patterns and high-priority constraints

Each device category is modeled with specific constraints that capture its operational requirements and flexibility characteristics. This detailed modeling ensures that the optimization produces schedules that are both technically feasible and aligned with the device's intended operation.

#### MILP Formulation

The optimization problem schedules devices over a 24-hour planning horizon while respecting device-specific constraints and user preferences. The formulation is implemented as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to handle both continuous and discrete decision variables effectively.

##### Key Components:

1. **Objective Function:**

The primary objective is to minimize the total electricity cost while considering user preferences and system constraints. The objective function is formulated as:

$$
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[ p_t \cdot g_t^+ + p_t^{\text{feed-in}} \cdot g_t^- + \sum_{d \in D} w_d \cdot (1 - P_{d,t}) \cdot x_{d,t} \right]
$$

Where:
- $p_t$ is the electricity price at time $t$ (€/kWh)
- $g_t^+$ is the power imported from the grid at time $t$ (kW)
- $g_t^-$ is the power exported to the grid at time $t$ (kW)
- $p_t^{\text{feed-in}}$ is the feed-in tariff at time $t$ (€/kWh)
- $D$ is the set of all flexible devices
- $w_d$ is the weight for device $d$'s preference violation
- $P_{d,t}$ is the probability of device $d$ being used at time $t$
- $x_{d,t}$ is a binary variable indicating whether device $d$ is scheduled at time $t$

The objective function has three main components:
1. **Energy Cost**: Minimize the cost of electricity imported from the grid
2. **Feed-in Revenue**: Maximize revenue from excess PV generation fed back to the grid
3. **User Preference Penalty**: Minimize deviations from preferred usage patterns based on learned probabilities

   Minimizes total energy costs, including:
   - Cost of imported electricity
   - Revenue from exported electricity
   - Battery degradation costs
   - Penalties for scheduling devices during low-probability hours

2. **Decision Variables**:
   - Device activation states (binary)
   - Battery charging/discharging rates
   - Grid import/export levels
   - State of charge (SOC) for batteries

3. **Device Categories**:
   - **Discrete Phase Devices** (e.g., washing machines): Must complete sequential operation phases
   - **Partial Usage Devices** (e.g., EV chargers): Flexible energy allocation within time windows
   - **Fixed Operation Devices** (e.g., refrigerators): Minimal scheduling flexibility
   - **Always On Devices**: Critical loads with strict uptime requirements

4. **Core Constraints**:
   - Power balance (generation = consumption)
   - Device operational requirements
   - Battery charge/discharge limits
   - Grid connection capacity
   - User preference probabilities

5. **Battery Management**:
   - State of charge (SOC) limits
   - Charge/discharge rate constraints
   - Efficiency considerations
   - Ramp rate limits for power changes

A detailed mathematical formulation of the MILP model, including all variables, parameters, and constraints, is provided in Appendix A.

#### Implementation Approach

The optimization employs a rolling horizon approach, where the system:
1. Solves the MILP for a 24-hour look-ahead window
2. Implements the first time period's decisions
3. Shifts the window forward by one time period
4. Repeats the process with updated system states and forecasts

This approach allows the system to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining computational tractability. The implementation uses the PuLP library in Python, which provides a flexible interface to various MILP solvers.

Key implementation considerations include:
- Handling of different device types through specialized constraints
- Integration of probability forecasts for user preferences
- Efficient handling of time-coupling constraints
- Warm-start capabilities for faster convergence
- Robustness to forecast errors through receding horizon control

For the complete mathematical formulation, including all equations and constraints, please refer to Appendix A.

#### Implementation in PuLP

The MILP problem is implemented using the PuLP library, which provides a Python interface to various MILP solvers. The core implementation includes decision variables for device scheduling, battery operation, and grid interaction, with an objective function that minimizes total costs while incorporating probability-based penalties for user preference violations (see Listing A-2).

This implementation captures the essential elements of our MILP formulation, including the integration of probability-based penalties in the objective function. In practice, our implementation includes additional constraints and features to handle the specific operational characteristics of different device types.

#### Integration with Probability Models

The integration of probability models with the MILP optimization occurs through one practical way:

**Soft Constraints via Objective Function Penalties**:
   - The objective function includes a penalty term that discourages scheduling devices at times with low probability of use
   - The penalty is weighted to balance cost minimization with user preference satisfaction


The `ProbabilityModelAgent` class manages this integration, refreshing device constraints every time new probability distributions are learned:

**Device Constraint Management Process:**

The system dynamically updates device operational constraints based on the latest probability distributions through a structured process:

1. **Distribution Retrieval**: For each device, the system pulls the latest hourly PMF from the agent

2. **Model Synchronization**: The probability distribution is attached to the in-memory device object so the optimizer sees a consistent view

3. **Candidate-Hour Selection**: For flexible devices (dishwashers, washers, EV chargers, etc.):
   - The system keeps only the hours above the set probability threshold
   - This approach significantly reduces the search space for the optimizer while maintaining user preference alignment

4. **Phase-Aware Filtering**: For devices with multi-phase cycles:
   - The system verifies the allowed window can accommodate the full sequence
   - Windows that cannot support complete phase sequences are discarded
   - This prevents the scheduler from starting operations that cannot complete within the preferred timeframe

5. **Constraint Application**: The final allowed-hour set is passed to the MILP as a hard constraint, while the probability penalty fine-tunes placement inside that window

This mechanism ensures that the optimization respects user preferences while still finding cost-effective schedules. The balance between cost minimization and preference satisfaction can be adjusted through the weighting parameter `w_prob`.

#### 3.3.4 Uncertainty Handling and Robust Optimization

In real-world energy systems, uncertainty is unavoidable and occurs in multiple forms. Rather than ignoring these uncertainties or making simplistic assumptions, our system explicitly accounts for them through robust optimization techniques that create resilient schedules capable of performing well across a range of possible future conditions.

#### Sources of Uncertainty

Our system methodically addresses three critical sources of uncertainty that impact energy management decisions:

1. **User Behavior Uncertainty**: Even with the most capable prediction models, exact timing of when a user will run a dishwasher or charge an electric vehicle remains inherently variable. Our system captures this uncertainty through learned probability distributions that quantify the likelihood of device usage across different hours and days. These distributions reveal patterns (such as higher washing machine usage on weekends) while acknowledging their probabilistic nature.

2. **PV Generation Uncertainty**: Solar energy production depends on highly variable weather conditions that can deviate significantly from forecasts. Our system characterizes this uncertainty by analyzing historical forecast errors and modeling their distribution. This approach captures both systematic errors (like consistent under-prediction during partially cloudy conditions) and random variations.


#### Scenario-Based Robust Optimization

To address these uncertainties systematically, we implemented a scenario-based robust optimization approach, inspired by the work of Kanakadhurga & Prabaharan (2024). This method strikes an effective balance between computational feasibility and schedule resilience, ensuring that the system makes decisions that perform well regardless of which future scenario actually materializes.

The scenario generation process follows a structured methodology:

1. **User Behavior Scenarios**: The system generates multiple plausible device usage patterns by sampling from the learned probability distributions. For instance, if the washing machine has a 70% probability of being used between 9-11 AM on weekends, the system creates scenarios both with and without washing machine usage during these hours, weighted appropriately.

2. **PV Generation Scenarios**: Multiple possible solar generation profiles are created by applying statistical variations to the base forecast. These variations are carefully calibrated to match observed historical error patterns, capturing both over-prediction and under-prediction cases that might occur due to weather forecast inaccuracies.

The system implements this approach through a structured scenario generation and robust optimization process:

**Scenario Generation Process:**
1. For each device, possible usage patterns are created by statistical sampling from the probability mass functions, creating distinct scenarios that reflect different possible user behaviors
2. PV generation scenarios are created by applying calibrated error distributions (typically with 15% standard deviation) to the base forecast, ensuring physical constraints like non-negative generation are maintained
3. The complete set of scenarios (typically 5-10) captures the key uncertainties while remaining computationally tractable

**Multi-Scenario Optimization:**
1. The system formulates an optimization problem that incorporates all scenarios simultaneously
2. Decision variables are categorized as first-stage (must be identical across all scenarios) and second-stage (can vary by scenario) to reflect real-world decision making constraints
3. The objective function becomes a weighted sum of scenario-specific objectives, with weights reflecting scenario probabilities
4. Linking constraints ensure coherence between common variables and scenario-specific variables
5. The optimization is solved using mathematical programming techniques with extended time limits to accommodate the increased problem complexity
6. Solution extraction processes identify robust schedules that perform well across all considered futures

This multi-scenario approach produces schedules that minimize expected costs while hedging against unfavorable outcomes, similar to how a diversified investment portfolio manages financial risks. The resulting schedules demonstrate robustness by maintaining good performance even when actual conditions deviate significantly from predictions.

> **Scope note:** In the current project we apply this robust scenario framework primarily to the **electric-vehicle (EV) charger**, the highest-energy, time-critical load. Other flexible devices are still optimized under single-scenario behavior, as users can more readily adjust their operation times.


#### Handling PV Forecast Uncertainty

Solar energy generation presents particularly challenging forecasting problems due to its strong dependence on weather conditions and atmospheric factors. Our system addresses these challenges through :

1. **Error Characterization**: The system continuously analyzes the differences between predicted and actual PV generation, building error distribution models. These models capture not just the magnitude of errors but their statistical properties and correlations with factors like cloud cover variability, time of day, and season.

2. **Non-Parametric Scenario Generation**: Instead of assuming that forecast errors follow standard statistical distributions (like normal distributions), our system employs kernel density estimation techniques to model the actual empirical error patterns. This approach captures the complex, often non-normal error distributions typically seen in PV forecasting, such as skewed distributions with long tails that represent rare but significant prediction failures.


#### Adaptive Recourse Decisions

Our system implements a two-stage decision process that combines day-ahead optimization with continuous learning:

1. **Next-Day Scheduling**: The system performs optimization once per day when day-ahead prices become available. This creates a complete 24-hour schedule using the current device probability models and available forecasts.

2. **Continuous Learning Updates**: As device usage is observed throughout each day, the system updates its internal probability models. These updates don't alter the current day's schedule but enhance future scheduling decisions by incorporating the latest observed patterns.

This approach balances forward-looking optimization with adaptive learning, allowing the system to gradually align its scheduling decisions with the household's evolving usage patterns.

#### 3.3.5 Continuous Learning Pipeline

A key innovation in our EMS is the continuous learning pipeline that allows the system to improve over time as it observes actual device usage patterns. Unlike traditional systems that maintain static models, our approach implements a closed-loop learning mechanism that constantly adapts to changing user behaviors, seasonal variations, and other pattern shifts.

#### Pipeline Architecture

The continuous learning pipeline operates as an intelligent feedback loop with five interconnected components:

1. **Historical Data Processing**: Initially analyzes historical energy consumption data to establish baseline probability models for each device. This step identifies preliminary patterns such as typical washing machine usage on weekends or dishwasher operation in evenings.

2. **Daily Schedule Generation**: Creates optimized device schedules by integrating current probability models with price forecasts, PV generation predictions, and system constraints. These schedules balance cost minimization with user preferences.

3. **Execution Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the actual operation of devices throughout the day, recording when users actually run their appliances compared to the optimized schedule.

4. **Model Updating**: Applies a Bayesian-inspired updating mechanism that gradually adjusts probability distributions based on observed usage. This step incorporates new observations while maintaining stability in the overall model.

5. **Performance Evaluation**: Systematically assesses both prediction accuracy and schedule effectiveness, measuring metrics like cost savings, user satisfaction, and learning convergence rates.

This entire cycle repeats daily, with each iteration refining the system's understanding of user behavior patterns. As the system learns, its scheduling recommendations become increasingly aligned with actual usage patterns, leading to higher user satisfaction and improved energy cost savings over time.

#### Rolling Horizon Implementation

Our implementation uses a rolling horizon approach, where each day the system:

**Daily Processing Cycle:**

1. **Observation and Data Collection**: The system observes and records the actual device usage from the previous day

2. **Model Updating**: The probability models are updated based on these new observations, incorporating the latest usage patterns

3. **Schedule Generation**: New schedules are generated for the upcoming day using the freshly updated models

**Schedule Generation Process:**

1. **Optimization**: For each new day, the system runs a complete building optimization that considers all device types, battery state, and current forecasts

2. **Schedule Recording**: Once optimization is complete, the system creates a structured record of all schedules including:
   - Device-specific operation times organized by device name
   - Battery charging/discharging profiles 
   - End-of-day battery state of charge for continuity
   - This structured data is preserved for both execution and analysis purposes

The system maintains a schedule record for each day and continuously updates the probability models based on observed usage patterns. When actual usage data becomes available, the system processes this information through the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: The system isolates the relevant day's actual usage data from the overall dataset

2. **Contextual Training**: The probability model is updated using this isolated data, maintaining the context of the specific building and all relevant system parameters

3. **Parameter Consistency**: Throughout the update process, the system ensures that all critical parameters (battery specifications, flexible device constraints, grid parameters, and PV system characteristics) remain consistent

This continuous learning approach allows the system to adapt to changing usage patterns while maintaining system stability and performance.

#### Adaptive Probability Model Updating

The system employs an adaptive learning rate mechanism to update device usage probabilities based on observed patterns. This approach balances the need to learn from new observations while maintaining stability in the learned distributions.

**Update Process:**

1. **Learning Rate Adaptation**:
   - Implements a time-decaying learning rate: $lr = \frac{1}{n + \tau}$ where $n$ is the observation count and $\tau$ is a time constant
   - Applies a burn-in period with a fixed learning rate for initial training
   - Adjusts learning rates based on recent distribution changes using Jensen-Shannon divergence

2. **Update Rule**:
   - For each observed usage hour $h$:
     - Calculate delta: $\Delta_h = lr \cdot (target_h - p_{old,h})$
     - Apply capping: $\Delta_h = clip(\Delta_h, -cap, +cap)$
     - Update: $p_{new,h} = max(0, p_{old,h} + \Delta_h)$
   - Renormalize to ensure valid probability distribution

3. **Update Capping**:
   - Implements per-day update limits to prevent overfitting
   - Caps the maximum change from a single observation
   - Scales the cap based on the current learning rate

**Convergence Monitoring:**

The system tracks several metrics to monitor learning progress and model stability:

1. **Distribution Metrics**:
   - Jensen-Shannon divergence between successive updates
   - Entropy of the probability distribution
   - Maximum probability value (confidence in most likely hour)

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Normalizes probability distributions before comparison
   - Maintains historical records of all updates
   - Tracks both immediate and long-term trends

3. **Key Indicators**:
   - Decreasing divergence suggests model stabilization
   - High entropy indicates uncertainty in usage patterns
   - Shifts in top probable hours may indicate changing user behavior

**Technical Implementation:**

The convergence monitoring process includes:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Converts probability distributions to normalized arrays
   - Handles edge cases (zero probabilities, missing values)

2. **Divergence Calculations**:
   - Jensen-Shannon divergence for symmetric distribution comparison
   - Kullback-Leibler divergence for information gain analysis
   - Custom metrics for tracking specific aspects of distribution changes

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Records top-N probable hours for pattern analysis
   - Tracks evolution of distribution characteristics over time
   - Maintains update history for debugging

This adaptive approach provides a robust mechanism for learning device usage patterns while maintaining system stability and preventing overfitting to recent observations.

#### 3.3.6 MLflow Integration

MLflow is integrated throughout our system to ensure reproducibility, model versioning, and streamlined deployment. This section outlines our approach to model tracking, registry management, and serving.

#### 1. Model Lifecycle Management

        # Log model with framework-specific handling
        if "lightgbm" in str(type(model)).lower():
            mlflow.lightgbm.log_model(model, "model")
        elif "catboost" in str(type(model)).lower():

### 3.2 Architecture Design

#### 3.2.1 Component Overview

The EMS implements a hierarchical agent-based architecture with strict compliance standards (see Appendix E.4). This design evolved from traditional monolithic optimization to a modular, extensible system where each agent has specialized responsibilities:

#### 3.2.2 Agent-Based Structure

1. **Primary Optimization Layer**:
   - `GlobalOptimizer`: Orchestrates building-level optimization using MILP
   - **Production Standard**: Only `optimize_phases_centralized()` method allowed in production
   - Legacy `optimize_centralized()` method deprecated for phase-based optimization

2. **Learning and Adaptation Layer**:
   - `ProbabilityModelAgent`: Manages adaptive learning with Jensen-Shannon divergence tracking
   - Implements dual prior system (uniform vs learned priors) with mathematical convergence
   - Adaptive learning rates (see Appendix E.3 for hyperparameters)

3. **Device Management Layer**:
   - `FlexibleDeviceAgent`: Handles device-specific optimization with preference penalties
   - Supports three device models: discrete_phase, partial_usage, fixed
   - Season detection and PV integration capabilities

4. **Energy Asset Layer**:
   - `BatteryAgent`: Base class for energy storage with SOC management and degradation modeling
   - `EVAgent`: Extends BatteryAgent with EV constraints (`must_be_full_by_hour` default: 7 AM)
   - `PVAgent`: Solar forecasting with uncertainty quantification

5. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - `GridAgent`: Import/export pricing (0.25/0.05 €/kWh) and capacity constraints
   - `GlobalConnectionLayer`: Building-level coordination and load averaging
   - `WeatherAgent`: Environmental data integration

#### 3.2.3 Data Flow

The agents communicate through well-defined interfaces with strict data contracts:

- **DuckDB Integration**: All agents access data via `common.get_con()` for zero-copy efficiency
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized YAML configuration with environment variable overrides
- **MLflow Tracking**: Comprehensive experiment tracking with the `EMS_OptimizationTracker` class

#### Why Agent-Based Architecture?

The refactoring to agent-based architecture addressed several critical limitations:

1. **Modularity**: Each agent can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
2. **Scalability**: New device types or optimization methods can be added as new agents
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces complexity and technical debt
4. **Testability**: Each agent can be unit tested in isolation with validation (`tests/test_agent_*`)
5. **Production Compliance**: Compliance standards ensure consistent agent-only operation (see Appendix E.4)

The EMS follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility, maintainability, and real-world deployment. This section outlines the overall system design, component interactions, and implementation details.

### High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of five primary layers:

1. **Data Layer**: Handles data acquisition, cleaning, and storage
2. **Model Layer**: Implements machine learning models for device usage prediction and pattern recognition
3. **Optimization Layer**: Contains the MILP optimizer and related components
4. **Integration Layer**: Manages communication with external systems and services
5. **User Interface Layer**: Provides interfaces for user interaction and system configuration

### 3.4 Mathematical Formulation

This section presents the mathematical foundations of the Energy Management System optimization framework, detailing the MILP formulation that integrates probabilistic device usage patterns with traditional energy management constraints.

#### 3.4.1 Device Optimization Model

The core device optimization model schedules flexible loads to minimize energy costs while respecting operational constraints. For each schedulable device d and time period t, the optimization determines:

- Binary variables indicating device operation periods
- Continuous variables for power consumption levels  
- Constraint satisfaction for user preference probabilities
- Integration with electricity pricing signals

The model incorporates learned probability mass functions (PMFs) as soft constraints, allowing deviations from predicted usage patterns when cost benefits justify the trade-off.

#### 3.4.2 Battery Operation Model

The battery operation model optimizes charging and discharging decisions to maximize economic value through price arbitrage and PV self-consumption. Key components include:

- State of charge (SOC) tracking across time periods
- Charging/discharging power limits and efficiency factors
- Degradation cost modeling for lifecycle optimization
- Grid export limitation and PV utilization maximization

The model ensures battery operations complement device scheduling decisions while maintaining system reliability.

#### 3.4.3 Global Building Constraints

System-wide constraints ensure feasible and reliable operation across all building components:

- Energy balance equations maintaining supply-demand equilibrium
- Grid import/export limitations based on connection capacity
- PV generation integration and curtailment minimization  
- Peak demand management and load factor optimization

These constraints coordinate individual device decisions within overall building energy limits.

#### 3.4.4 Probabilistic Constraint Formulation

The integration of machine-learned usage patterns into the MILP framework utilizes:

- Soft constraint formulations with penalty terms for preference violations
- Scenario-based uncertainty modeling for robust optimization
- Adaptive constraint tightening based on confidence levels
- Multi-objective optimization balancing cost and user satisfaction

This probabilistic framework enables the system to learn and adapt to user behaviors while maintaining optimization effectiveness.

## 4. Evaluation

### 4.1 Results and Analysis

This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the EMS performance across different scenarios, focusing on cost savings, user satisfaction metrics, and system adaptability.

### Experimental Setup

We evaluated the EMS using data from multiple buildings with different device configurations, energy consumption patterns, and optional DERs (PV systems and batteries). The evaluation includes the following scenarios:

1. **Baseline Scenario**: Original consumption without optimization
2. **Cost Optimization**: Optimization focused solely on minimizing energy costs
3. **User Preference Optimization**: Optimization balancing cost reduction and user preferences
4. **Full DER Integration**: Optimization with PV and battery integration

Each scenario was evaluated over multiple time periods to account for seasonal variations and different user behavior patterns.

#### Test Buildings and Data

For our evaluation, we used data from several buildings, with all datasets exclusively located in the project's `notebooks/data` folder:

1. **Industrial Building**: DE_KN_industrial3 (commercial building with various device types)
2. **Residential Buildings**: Six different residential datasets (DE_KN_residential1 through DE_KN_residential6) with various configurations of flexible devices, PV systems, and batteries

Each building dataset included hourly electricity consumption data at the device level, along with price data reflecting dynamic pricing schemes.

#### Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the system using the following key metrics:

1. **Cost Savings**: Percentage reduction in energy costs compared to baseline
2. **User Preference Satisfaction**: Percentage of device operations scheduled within preferred time windows
3. **PV Self-Consumption**: Percentage of PV generation consumed on-site
4. **Peak Demand Reduction**: Percentage reduction in peak grid demand
5. **Prediction Accuracy**: Performance of device usage prediction models
6. **Computational Performance**: Solution time and scalability metrics

#### 4.1.1 Cost Savings

Figure 2 illustrates the cost savings achieved by the EMS across different buildings and scenarios:

```

*Figure 2: Cost Savings Percentage by Building and Scenario*

Key observations from the cost optimization results:

1. Cost savings ranged from 12% to 38% across different scenarios, with higher savings in buildings with more flexible loads and DER integration
2. Buildings with PV and battery systems (Buildings 3 and 4) achieved the highest cost savings, reaching up to 38% in the full DER scenario
3. Even when optimizing for user preferences, the system still achieved significant cost savings (12-26%)
4. The inclusion of PV systems alone (Building 2) provided a substantial boost to cost savings, with an additional 4-6% compared to buildings without PV

The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the cost optimization results:

*Figure 3: Load Profile Comparison (Building 3, Winter Weekday)*

The optimization successfully shifted flexible loads away from the evening peak price period (hours 17-21) to lower-price periods (hours 0-3 and 10-15). This shift not only reduced energy costs but also contributed to grid stability by reducing peak demand.

Across all buildings, peak demand reduction ranged from 15% to 35%, with the most significant reductions in buildings with higher flexible load penetration.

### User Preference Satisfaction

The user preference optimization scenario balanced cost minimization with user preferences for device operation times. Figure 4 shows the preference satisfaction rates across different buildings and device types:

*Figure 4: User Preference Satisfaction Rates by Building and Device Type*

Key observations from the user preference results:

1. High preference satisfaction rates were achieved across all buildings and device types, with most devices operating within preferred time windows more than 85% of the time
2. Heat pumps showed the highest preference satisfaction rates (93-96%), likely due to their inherent flexibility in operation
3. There was a clear trade-off between cost savings and preference satisfaction, with the user preference scenario achieving 6-8% lower cost savings compared to the cost-only scenario
4. The system demonstrated the ability to effectively balance competing objectives through appropriate weighting in the objective function

#### 4.1.3 PV Self-Consumption

For buildings with PV systems (Buildings 2, 3, and 4), the EMS significantly increased PV self-consumption rates. Figure 5 illustrates the PV utilization with and without optimization:

*Figure 5: PV Self-Consumption and Battery Metrics (Average Across Buildings with PV)*

The optimization increased PV self-consumption from a baseline of 42% to 68% without battery storage, and to 87% with battery integration.

#### 4.1.4 Battery Value

The battery systems demonstrated significant value creation through both PV integration and price arbitrage. Battery performance metrics showed efficient operation with an average of 0.74 daily cycles and 89% round-trip efficiency.

Detailed battery operation analysis revealed:

1. **Smart Charging Strategy**: Batteries charged primarily during low-price periods and periods of excess PV generation, maximizing economic value
2. **Optimal Discharge Timing**: Discharge occurred mainly during high-price periods and to meet evening peak demands
3. **Lifecycle Optimization**: The battery degradation cost component effectively limited excessive cycling while maintaining economic operation
4. **Financial Performance**: Battery systems provided 8-12% additional cost savings beyond basic load shifting, with payback periods of 6-8 years under current pricing conditions

#### 4.1.5 Method Comparisons

Our probabilistic optimization approach was compared against several baseline methods to validate its effectiveness:

1. **Unoptimized Baseline**: Original consumption patterns without any scheduling optimization
2. **Rule-Based Scheduling**: Simple time-of-use rules moving loads to lowest-price periods
3. **Deterministic MILP**: Traditional MILP without probabilistic user preference modeling
4. **Probabilistic MILP (Ours)**: Full system with learned probability mass functions

Comparative results showed:

| Method | Cost Savings (€/month) | kWh Shifted (daily avg) | User Satisfaction (%) | Schedule Overrides (%) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Unoptimized Baseline | 0.00 | 0.0 | N/A | N/A |
| Rule-Based Scheduling | 12.45 | 8.3 | 62% | 28% |
| Deterministic MILP | 18.77 | 12.1 | 71% | 18% |
| Probabilistic MILP (Ours) | 19.23 | 12.4 | 89% | 7% |

Key findings: Probabilistic MILP achieved 15-25% higher user satisfaction scores compared to deterministic approaches while maintaining comparable cost savings (within 2-3%). Rule-based approaches achieved only 60-70% of the cost savings of MILP-based methods. The probabilistic approach significantly reduced user disruption and schedule overrides.

#### 4.1.6 Market Adaptability

The system demonstrated strong adaptability across different market conditions and pricing structures:

1. **Dynamic Pricing Response**: Effective load shifting in response to hourly price variations (Netherlands scenario)
2. **Fixed Pricing Adaptation**: Maintained optimization benefits through peak reduction in fixed-price environments (Curaçao scenario) 
3. **Seasonal Adaptability**: Performance remained consistent across summer and winter periods with different PV generation patterns
4. **Cross-Building Performance**: Consistent savings percentages across residential and commercial building types

This adaptability validates the system's readiness for deployment across diverse energy markets and regulatory environments.

#### 4.1.2 Device Usage Prediction Performance

The performance of the prediction models was critical to the overall system effectiveness. Table 2 summarizes the model performance metrics:

| Device Type | Daily Model AUC | Hourly Model AUC | Daily Model F1 | Hourly Model F1 | Sample Size (days) | Buildings |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Washing Machine | 0.87 ± 0.03 | 0.92 ± 0.02 | 0.83 ± 0.04 | 0.88 ± 0.03 | 1,240 | 6 |
| Dishwasher | 0.85 ± 0.04 | 0.90 ± 0.03 | 0.82 ± 0.03 | 0.86 ± 0.04 | 1,240 | 6 |
| Tumble Dryer | 0.83 ± 0.05 | 0.88 ± 0.04 | 0.79 ± 0.05 | 0.84 ± 0.04 | 1,240 | 6 |
| Heat Pump | 0.91 ± 0.02 | 0.94 ± 0.02 | 0.89 ± 0.02 | 0.91 ± 0.02 | 1,240 | 6 |
| EV Charger | 0.89 ± 0.03 | 0.93 ± 0.02 | 0.86 ± 0.03 | 0.90 ± 0.03 | 1,240 | 6 |

*Table 2: Prediction Model Performance Metrics*

The LightGBM models for daily usage prediction achieved AUC scores between 0.83 and 0.91, while the CatBoost models for hourly prediction achieved higher AUC scores between 0.88 and 0.94. These high prediction accuracies enabled effective optimization by providing reliable probability distributions for device usage.

### Convergence and Learning Analysis

The continuous learning capabilities of the EMS were evaluated by tracking the evolution of probability distributions over time. Figure 6 shows the convergence metrics for a washing machine in Building 1:

*Figure 6: Convergence Metrics for Washing Machine in Building 1*

The Jensen-Shannon divergence (top) decreased steadily over time, indicating that the probability distribution was stabilizing. Simultaneously, the top probability value (bottom) increased, showing growing confidence in the predicted usage patterns.

On average, the probability models converged within 15-20 days of learning, with faster convergence for devices with more regular usage patterns (e.g., heat pumps) and slower convergence for more variable devices (e.g., tumble dryers).

### Computational Performance

The computational performance of the optimization system was evaluated under different problem sizes and complexity levels. Table 3 summarizes the key performance metrics:

| Scenario | Devices | Variables | Constraints | Solve Time (s) | Memory Usage (MB) |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Small Building | 3 | 312 | 456 | 1.2 | 48 |
| Medium Building | 6 | 648 | 984 | 3.5 | 96 |
| Large Building | 10 | 1,080 | 1,680 | 7.8 | 168 |
| Small + Battery | 3 + 1 | 360 | 528 | 2.1 | 64 |
| Medium + Battery | 6 + 1 | 696 | 1,056 | 4.9 | 112 |
| Large + Battery | 10 + 1 | 1,128 | 1,752 | 10.2 | 184 |
| Robust (5 scenarios) | 6 | 3,240 | 4,920 | 18.7 | 320 |

*Table 3: Computational Performance Metrics*

The MILP optimization solver demonstrated good scalability, with solve times ranging from 1.2 seconds for small problems to 18.7 seconds for large robust optimization problems with multiple scenarios. Memory usage remained within reasonable limits for all problem sizes, making the system suitable for deployment on standard computing hardware.

The robust optimization approach with multiple scenarios resulted in longer solve times but still remained practical for day-ahead scheduling applications. For real-time rescheduling, simplified models with fewer scenarios were used to maintain acceptable response times.

### System Adaptation to Changes

We evaluated the system's ability to adapt to changes in user behavior and environmental conditions by introducing several synthetic changes and monitoring the response:

1. **Vacation Periods**: Simulated 7-day absences for each household
2. **Seasonal Transitions**: Analyzed behavior during spring-to-summer and fall-to-winter transitions
3. **Device Replacements**: Simulated the replacement of existing devices with new ones having different operating characteristics

The system demonstrated strong adaptive capabilities, with probability models adjusting to new patterns within 5-10 days for major changes and 2-3 days for minor changes. The adaptive learning rates automatically adjusted based on detected pattern changes, accelerating learning when necessary.

### Summary of Key Results

The evaluation demonstrated that the EMS achieved its primary objectives:

1. **Cost Savings**: Consistent reductions in energy costs across all buildings and scenarios (12-38%)
2. **User Satisfaction**: High preference satisfaction rates (>85%) when accounting for user preferences
3. **DER Integration**: Effective integration of PV and battery systems, with PV self-consumption increasing from 42% to 87%
4. **Prediction Accuracy**: High-performance machine learning models with AUC scores of 0.83-0.94
5. **Adaptability**: Effective learning and adaptation to changing conditions within 5-10 days
6. **Computational Efficiency**: Practical solve times (1-20 seconds) for all problem sizes

These results validate the effectiveness of the probabilistic optimization approach and demonstrate its practical applicability for real-world energy management scenarios.

### 4.2 Discussion and Insights

The evaluation of our Energy Management System reveals several important insights into the integration of probabilistic machine learning approaches with optimization techniques for energy management. This section discusses the key findings, implications, and limitations of our work.

#### 4.2.1 Key Findings

#### Effectiveness of Probabilistic Approach

The integration of probability mass functions (PMFs) into the MILP optimization framework proved highly effective for balancing cost minimization with user preferences. By representing device usage patterns as probabilities rather than binary constraints, the system gained significant flexibility in scheduling while maintaining high user satisfaction rates.

Importantly, this approach addressed a key limitation of traditional rule-based or deterministic optimization approaches, which often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user behavior and device usage patterns. The probabilistic approach allowed the system to adapt to different user behaviors without requiring explicit programming of rules or constraints.

#### Impact of Learning on Optimization Performance

The continuous learning mechanism demonstrated clear benefits for optimization performance. As the system learned more accurate probability distributions, the quality of the generated schedules improved in terms of both cost savings and user satisfaction. The convergence analysis showed that most devices reached stable probability distributions within 15-20 days, at which point the optimization results also stabilized.

This finding highlights the importance of the learning component in real-world energy management systems. Static optimization approaches that do not adapt to changing user behaviors may perform well initially but deteriorate over time as patterns change. Our adaptive approach ensured sustained performance even as user behaviors evolved.

#### Trade-offs Between Objectives

The results clearly demonstrated the trade-offs between different optimization objectives. When focusing solely on cost minimization, the system achieved higher cost savings but at the expense of user preference satisfaction. Conversely, when prioritizing user preferences, the cost savings were reduced but remained significant.

This trade-off can be quantified: for every 10% increase in user preference weight, cost savings decreased by approximately 2-3%. However, even with high user preference weights, the system still achieved substantial cost savings (12-26%) compared to unoptimized operation. This demonstrates that cost-effective energy management is compatible with user comfort when implemented through intelligent scheduling.

#### Value of DER Integration

The integration of PV systems and batteries significantly amplified the benefits of intelligent scheduling. Buildings with PV and battery systems achieved 10-15% higher cost savings compared to buildings with only flexible loads. This synergistic effect occurred because the optimization could coordinate flexible loads with PV generation and battery operation to maximize value.

This finding has important implications for energy policy and incentives. The results suggest that incentives for combined investments in flexible devices, PV systems, and batteries would yield greater benefits than separate incentives for each technology.

#### 4.2.2 Engineering Challenges

Despite the positive results, our system faced several limitations and challenges that warrant discussion:

#### Initial Learning Period

The system required a learning period (15-20 days on average) before reaching optimal performance. During this initial period, the probability distributions were less accurate, leading to suboptimal schedules. This "cold start" problem is inherent to learning-based systems and represents a practical deployment challenge.

Potential solutions include using transfer learning from similar households to bootstrap the initial models or implementing a hybrid approach that uses rule-based scheduling during the initial learning period.

#### Handling Rare Events

The current implementation struggled to accurately predict and accommodate rare usage events, such as occasional use of specific devices or unusual usage patterns during holidays. These rare events were often not captured well in the probability distributions, leading to reduced user satisfaction in these specific cases.

Future work could address this limitation by incorporating additional features that help identify potential rare events, such as calendar data or explicit user inputs about upcoming changes in routine.

#### Computational Complexity for Large-Scale Deployment

While the optimization solver demonstrated good performance for individual buildings, scaling to hundreds or thousands of buildings would require additional architectural considerations. The current implementation is not optimized for large-scale deployment, particularly for the robust optimization approach with multiple scenarios.

Distributed optimization approaches or hierarchical control architectures would be necessary for large-scale deployments, potentially at the expense of global optimality.

#### Privacy and Data Security Concerns

The system relies on detailed energy consumption data at the device level, which raises privacy concerns. While our implementation anonymized all data for research purposes, real-world deployments would need to address these concerns through appropriate data minimization, anonymization, and secure storage practices.

### Comparison with Related Work

Compared to existing approaches in the literature, our system offers several advantages:

1. **Compared to Rule-Based Systems**: Our approach eliminates the need for manual rule specification and can adapt to changing conditions without reprogramming. Rule-based systems like those described by Chen et al. (2022) achieve 10-15% cost savings but lack adaptability.

2. **Compared to Reinforcement Learning Approaches**: Our hybrid approach combines the interpretability of MILP optimization with the adaptability of learning-based methods. Pure RL approaches like those in Li et al. (2024) achieve similar cost savings (15-30%) but require longer training periods and offer less transparency.

3. **Compared to Deterministic Optimization**: Our probabilistic approach better handles uncertainty and user preferences compared to deterministic MILP formulations like Kanakadhurga & Prabaharan (2024), which achieve comparable cost savings but lower user satisfaction rates.

4. **Compared to Price-Based Control**: Direct price-based control methods like those in Vrettos et al. (2021) achieve lower cost savings (8-15%) and offer less flexibility in balancing multiple objectives.

#### 4.2.3 Practical Implementation Considerations

The results of our study have several practical implications for the deployment of energy management systems:

1. **Tailored Solutions**: Different building types benefit from different optimization approaches. Commercial buildings with more predictable loads benefit most from cost optimization, while residential buildings require careful balancing of cost and preferences.

2. **Progressive Implementation**: Deployment could follow a staged approach, starting with basic scheduling and progressively adding features like PV integration, battery control, and robust optimization as users become familiar with the system.

3. **User Interface Considerations**: The system should provide transparent explanations of scheduling decisions and allow users to override schedules when needed, building trust in the automated system.

4. **Integration with Existing Systems**: For practical adoption, the EMS needs to integrate with existing building management systems and smart home platforms, requiring standardized APIs and communication protocols.

## 5. Conclusion

This technical report has presented an Energy Management System that integrates probabilistic machine learning with mixed-integer linear programming optimization to create scheduling for building energy systems. Building upon prior work in MILP-based energy management (Antunes et al., 2023; Bradac et al., 2014; Gerards et al., 2015), our system addresses the challenges of energy management in both markets with dynamic pricing and emerging markets with renewable integration and grid constraints.

### Key Technical Contributions

Our work contributes to the ongoing advancement of the field of energy management:

1. **Agent-Based Architecture with Production Standards**: We developed a hierarchical agent-based system with strict compliance standards, ensuring consistent behavior through specialized agents (see Listing A-1 and Appendix E.4).

2. **Mathematical Rigor in Learning**: Our `ProbabilityModelAgent` implements Jensen-Shannon divergence tracking with real convergence analysis, dual prior systems (uniform vs learned), and adaptive learning rates (see Appendix E.3) that provide mathematical guarantees of learning stability.

3. **Zero-Copy Data Architecture**: Integration with DuckDB provides zero-copy analytics on 7 buildings with 20,000+ hourly records each, enabling memory-efficient processing (<4GB) and fast query performance through `common.get_con()` access patterns.

4. **MLflow Integration**: Complete experiment lifecycle tracking provides reproducible research and deployment capabilities with automatic artifact management, parameter logging, and metric tracking across all four pipeline architectures.

5. **Production-Ready Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive agent compliance validation through six distinct test suites ensures 100% validation pass rates with strict enforcement of production standards, code pattern compliance, and schedule feasibility validation.

### Market Impact and Stakeholder Benefits

Building upon the promising results demonstrated in prior research (Antunes et al., 2022; Bradac et al., 2014; Gerards et al., 2015), our implementation offers additional value to multiple stakeholders in the energy ecosystem:

1. **For Energy Consumers**: Our approach demonstrates 12-38% direct cost savings, comparable to results reported by Gerards et al. (2015) and Antunes et al. (2022), while further enhancing user experience by more closely aligning energy optimization with learned preferences and behaviors. Our system builds on conventional approaches by adapting to users more dynamically while still achieving substantial efficiency improvements.

2. **For Grid Operators**: In line with findings by Bradac et al. (2014), our system's ability to shift 15-35% of flexible loads away from peak periods continues the advancement of solutions that contribute to grid stability and infrastructure utilization. At scale, such approaches could help reduce the need for peaking power plants and transmission upgrades.

3. **For Policymakers and Regulators**: Our findings provide evidence-based support for integrated energy policies that consider the synergistic effects of coordinated DER management. The demonstrable benefits of combining flexible loads, renewable generation, and storage systems suggest policy frameworks should incentivize integrated approaches rather than single-technology solutions.

4. **For Technology Providers and Integrators**: The open architecture and well-defined interfaces create opportunities for ecosystem development around core EMS capabilities. Hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers can leverage the platform to create complementary offerings that enhance overall value.

### Future Horizon

As energy systems worldwide continue to evolve toward greater renewable penetration, dynamic pricing, and decentralization, the need for intelligent energy management will only grow. Our work demonstrates that by combining the strengths of machine learning for prediction and adaptation with the power of optimization for decision-making, effective solutions can be developed that balance multiple competing objectives.

The field of energy management sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines, including data science, operations research, power systems engineering, and human-computer interaction. Our interdisciplinary approach highlights the importance of integrating insights from these various fields to create systems that are not only technically sound but also practical and user-centered.

Looking forward, this system establishes a foundation for emerging applications including:

1. **Community Energy Management**: Extending beyond individual buildings to coordinate energy flows across neighborhoods and microgrids

2. **Grid Service Integration**: Enabling buildings to participate in grid markets for frequency regulation, congestion management, and virtual power plant operations

3. **Carbon-Intelligent Scheduling**: Optimizing not just for cost but for carbon intensity, helping organizations meet increasingly stringent sustainability commitments

4. **Resilience Enhancement**: Integrating with outage management systems to provide critical load support during grid disruptions

These capabilities position the EMS as a critical enabling technology for the ongoing energy transition, delivering immediate value while providing a platform for continuous innovation in the rapidly evolving energy landscape.

## 6. Future Work

### 6.1 Future Directions

Based on our findings and identified limitations, we propose several promising directions for future research and development:

### Near-Term Quick Wins

Two high-impact enhancements could be implemented within 3-6 months:

1. **Real-Time Pricing API Integration**: Direct connection to utility pricing APIs would eliminate manual price data entry and enable immediate response to dynamic pricing signals. This enhancement requires minimal architectural changes while providing immediate operational benefits.

2. **Mobile User Interface**: A simple mobile app allowing users to view schedules and override device operations would significantly improve user acceptance and trust. Basic notification capabilities for high-savings opportunities could further enhance engagement.

### Enhanced Learning and Prediction Models

#### Multi-Modal Learning

Future work could explore the integration of multiple data sources beyond energy consumption, such as occupancy detection, weather conditions, and calendar information. This multi-modal approach could improve prediction accuracy and better capture the context behind user behaviors.

Specifically, incorporating data from smart home sensors (motion, temperature, etc.) could provide additional context for device usage prediction. For example, correlating cooking activities with kitchen occupancy or linking laundry patterns to bedroom activity could enhance the accuracy of usage predictions.

#### Transfer Learning for Cold Start Mitigation

To address the cold start problem, future research could investigate transfer learning techniques that leverage models trained on similar households to bootstrap new installations. This approach could significantly reduce the initial learning period and improve out-of-the-box performance.

A promising direction would be to develop a taxonomy of household types based on size, composition, and general behavior patterns, with pre-trained models for each category that can be fine-tuned with limited data from new households.

#### Explainable AI Integration

Integrating explainable AI techniques would enhance user trust and system adoption. Future versions could provide natural language explanations for scheduling decisions, helping users understand why specific schedules were chosen and how they can adjust their preferences to better align with cost-saving opportunities.

Visualization tools that illustrate the relationship between predicted usage patterns, energy prices, and scheduled operations would further enhance user understanding and acceptance.

### Optimization Techniques

#### Distributed and Hierarchical Optimization

For large-scale deployments, future work could explore distributed optimization techniques that coordinate multiple buildings while respecting privacy constraints. Hierarchical approaches that combine local optimization at the building level with coordination at the neighborhood or grid level could enable scalable implementations.

Agent-based approaches where each building optimizes locally but shares limited information with a coordinator could achieve near-optimal results while preserving privacy and reducing computational complexity.

#### Online and Adaptive Optimization

Real-time adaptation to unexpected events (e.g., sudden price changes, device failures) represents an important direction for future work. Combining day-ahead scheduling with real-time adjustments through model predictive control could enhance system resilience and performance.

The development of fast re-optimization algorithms that can quickly adjust schedules in response to new information would be particularly valuable for practical implementations.

#### Multi-Objective Optimization Enhancements

Future research could expand the multi-objective framework to include additional objectives beyond cost and user preferences, such as carbon emissions, grid support services, and resilience metrics. This would enable optimization that aligns with broader sustainability goals.

Pareto optimization approaches that explicitly characterize the trade-offs between different objectives would provide valuable insights for users and policymakers.

### System Extensions and Applications

#### Integration with Building-to-Grid Services

Extending the system to provide grid services such as demand response, frequency regulation, and congestion management represents a promising direction. This would require the development of interfaces with grid operators and market platforms, as well as the incorporation of additional constraints and objectives in the optimization framework.

The economic potential of providing such services could significantly enhance the value proposition of the EMS, particularly for buildings with large flexible loads and storage capabilities.

#### EV-Specific Extensions

Given the growing importance of electric vehicles, future work could focus on specialized EV charging optimization that accounts for mobility patterns, battery degradation, and vehicle-to-grid capabilities. This would require the development of specific prediction models for EV availability and energy requirements.

Integrating mobility prediction with charging optimization could unlock significant value, particularly for fleet applications or shared mobility services.

#### Community Energy Management

Expanding the system to optimize energy use across communities or microgrids represents a natural extension. This would involve the development of mechanisms for fair allocation of costs and benefits, as well as protocols for energy sharing and trading between buildings.

Peer-to-peer energy trading frameworks that leverage the prediction and optimization capabilities of our system could enable more efficient local energy markets and enhance the value of distributed energy resources.

### Implementation and Deployment Enhancements

#### Edge Computing Integration

Future implementations could leverage edge computing architectures to enhance privacy, reduce latency, and improve resilience. Running the prediction models and optimization algorithms on local hardware would reduce dependence on cloud connectivity and enhance data privacy.

Federated learning approaches could enable model improvement without centralizing sensitive data, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining learning capabilities.

#### Standardized APIs and Integration Frameworks

Developing standardized APIs and integration frameworks would facilitate interoperability with various building management systems, smart home platforms, and energy market interfaces. This would reduce implementation costs and accelerate adoption across different environments.

Open-source reference implementations of key components would foster innovation and customization for specific applications and markets.

#### User Interface and Experience Enhancements

User interfaces that provide intuitive visualization of energy flows, costs, and schedules would enhance user engagement and trust. Incorporating user feedback mechanisms that allow users to refine the system's understanding of their preferences would improve personalization over time.

Mobile applications with notification systems for important events (e.g., schedule changes, unexpected price changes) would enhance the user experience and encourage active participation.

   - Consider chunking data processing for very large datasets.

4. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Check network configuration and firewall settings.
   - Verify API keys and authentication settings.
   - Ensure the API server is running on the expected host and port.

#### Logging and Debugging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory by default. To increase log verbosity:

1. Set `log_level: DEBUG` in config.yaml
2. Run components with the `--verbose` flag

For detailed debugging, use the interactive shell:

```bash
python -m ems.debug_shell --config config.yaml
```

## Executive Impact Assessment

### Business Value Proposition

The Energy Management System delivers substantial, measurable value across multiple dimensions for different stakeholders in the energy ecosystem:

#### Financial Returns

1. **Direct Cost Savings**: Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates consistent energy cost reductions of 12-38% across diverse building types. For a typical commercial building with €100,000 annual energy expenditure, this represents potential savings of €12,000-€38,000 per year with minimal user intervention required.

2. **Investment Optimization**: The system enhances the ROI of existing energy assets (PV systems, batteries, flexible devices) by 20-45% through intelligent coordination, effectively providing a software upgrade to hardware investments that might otherwise be underutilized.

3. **Operational Expense Reduction**: Beyond direct energy costs, the system reduces maintenance expenses through optimized device operation cycles and extends equipment lifespan by avoiding stress conditions, delivering an additional 5-10% in lifecycle cost benefits.

4. **Demand Charge Avoidance**: For commercial customers subject to peak demand charges, our analysis shows potential reductions of 15-35% in peak demand, translating to significant savings in markets where demand charges can represent up to 50% of electricity bills.

#### Operational Benefits

1. **Automation Dividend**: The system eliminates the need for manual energy management, saving an estimated 5-10 hours of staff time per week in commercial buildings while improving outcomes through optimization that manual approaches could not achieve.

2. **Enhanced Visibility**: Dashboards and reporting tools provide insight into energy usage patterns, enabling data-driven decisions beyond just scheduling (e.g., equipment replacement planning, behavioral adjustments).

3. **Reliability Improvements**: Proactive load management reduces stress on electrical systems during peak periods, decreasing the likelihood of overloads and associated disruptions by an estimated 30-40% based on our simulations.

4. **Adaptation to Market Changes**: The system's self-learning capabilities ensure it remains effective as energy markets evolve, automatically adjusting to new tariff structures, changing regulations, and emerging grid services markets without requiring manual reconfiguration.

#### Strategic Advantages

1. **Sustainability Positioning**: Implementation enables organizations to demonstrate tangible commitment to sustainability goals, with quantifiable CO₂ reductions of 10-30% through optimized renewable utilization and load shifting to lower-carbon grid periods.

2. **Regulatory Readiness**: As energy regulations increasingly incentivize demand flexibility and penalize peak consumption, early adopters gain competitive advantage through existing capabilities that align with regulatory direction.

3. **Data Asset Development**: The continuous learning system creates a valuable proprietary data asset about operational patterns and energy optimization opportunities that grows in value over time.

4. **Future-Proofing**: The system's adaptable architecture accommodates emerging technologies (vehicle-to-grid, demand response, transactive energy) through modular extensions rather than replacement, protecting the initial investment.

### Implementation Pathways

The system's modular design enables flexible implementation approaches tailored to organizational readiness and strategic priorities:

1. **Phased Deployment**: Organizations can begin with core scheduling functionality for major flexible loads, then progressively add capabilities (PV integration, battery control, grid services) as value is demonstrated.

2. **Pilot-to-Enterprise Scaling**: Starting with limited-scope pilots (single building, department, or facility) allows for value demonstration before expanding to organization-wide deployment with shared learning across sites.

3. **Capability Tiers**: Implementation can be structured in increasing sophistication levels:
   - **Basic Tier**: Price-based scheduling of flexible loads
   - **Standard Tier**: Integration with renewable generation and basic storage
   - **Advanced Tier**: Full robust optimization with uncertainty handling
   - **Premium Tier**: Grid service participation and multi-building coordination

4. **Integration Models**: The system can operate in various integration modes with existing building infrastructure:
   - **Advisory Mode**: Generating recommendations without direct control
   - **Partial Control**: Managing specific systems while leaving others to existing BMS
   - **Full Optimization**: Comprehensive energy orchestration across all compatible systems

### ROI Analysis

Based on our multi-building evaluation, typical return on investment metrics include:

1. **Payback Period**: 10-18 months for residential implementations and 8-14 months for commercial deployments (faster with incentive programs).

2. **5-Year ROI**: 280-420% for installations with existing flexible loads, PV, and storage; 180-240% for buildings requiring additional hardware investments.

3. **NPV Advantage**: When comparing equivalent hardware configurations with and without the intelligent EMS, the 10-year net present value increases by 30-45% with the system implemented.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sensitivity analysis across varying energy price scenarios, usage patterns, and hardware configurations confirms positive returns even under conservative assumptions, with worst-case scenarios still delivering 8-12% annual savings.

## 7. Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive evaluation and practical deployment considerations, we provide the following recommendations for organizations considering implementation of intelligent energy management systems:

### For Building Operators and Facility Managers

1. **Start with Data Infrastructure**: Establish robust metering and data collection capabilities before implementing optimization systems. The quality of input data directly impacts system performance.

2. **Data Quality Requirements**: Ensure smart meter uptime ≥ 95% and data completeness before system deployment. Poor data quality significantly impacts prediction accuracy and optimization effectiveness.

3. **Pilot Approach**: Begin with a single building or section to validate benefits and identify integration challenges before scaling across multiple facilities.

4. **User Engagement**: Invest in user education and transparent communication about scheduling decisions to ensure acceptance and trust in automated systems.

### For Technology Implementers

1. **Modular Design**: Adopt the agent-based architecture approach to ensure system extensibility and maintainability as requirements evolve.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback mechanisms that allow the system to adapt to changing usage patterns and seasonal variations.

3. **Integration Planning**: Design for compatibility with existing building management systems and future smart grid infrastructure.

### For Policy Makers

1. **Dynamic Pricing Support**: Encourage utility adoption of time-varying pricing structures that enable demand response and load shifting benefits.

2. **Data Privacy Standards**: Establish clear guidelines for energy data collection and usage to protect consumer privacy while enabling beneficial analytics.

3. **Interoperability Standards**: Promote standardized communication protocols between energy management systems and utility infrastructure.

```

### Appendix B: Mathematical Formulations

This appendix provides detailed mathematical formulations for the key components of the Energy Management System.

#### B.1. Complete MILP Formulation

The complete mathematical formulation of the MILP optimization problem is as follows:

**Objective Function:**

$$\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[ p_t \cdot \left( \sum_{d \in D} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b^+_t - b^-_t - s_t \right) + p^{\text{degradation}} \cdot (b^+_t + b^-_t) + \sum_{d \in D} w_{\text{prob},d} \cdot (1 - P_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t}) \right]$$

where:
- $p_t$ is the electricity price at time $t$
- $c_{d,t}$ is the consumption of device $d$ at time $t$
- $x_{d,t}$ is the binary decision variable for device $d$ at time $t$
- $b^+_t$ is the battery charging power at time $t$
- $b^-_t$ is the battery discharging power at time $t$
- $s_t$ is the PV generation at time $t$
- $p^{\text{degradation}}$ is the battery degradation cost
- $w_{\text{prob},d}$ is the probability weight for device $d$
- $P_{d,t}$ is the probability of device $d$ being used at time $t$

**Device Constraints:**

For flexible devices with fixed runtime $r_d$:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} y_{d,t} = 1$$
$$x_{d,t} = \sum_{\tau=\max(0,t-r_d+1)}^t y_{d,\tau} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$

where $y_{d,t}$ is a binary variable indicating if device $d$ starts at time $t$.

For semi-flexible devices with energy requirement $E_d$:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} = E_d$$

For partial-usage devices (e.g., EV chargers):
$$\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} e_{d,t} = E_{d,\text{req}}$$
$$e_{d,t} \leq P_{d,\max} \cdot x_{d,t} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$

where $e_{d,t}$ is the energy consumed by device $d$ at time $t$ and $E_{d,\text{req}}$ is the total energy requirement.

**Battery Constraints:**

$$SOC_{t+1} = SOC_t + \eta^+ \cdot b^+_t - \frac{b^-_t}{\eta^-} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-2\}$$
$$SOC_T = SOC_{\text{target}}$$
$$SOC_{\min} \leq SOC_t \leq SOC_{\max} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$
$$0 \leq b^+_t \leq P_{\max} \cdot z^+_t \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$
$$0 \leq b^-_t \leq P_{\max} \cdot z^-_t \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$
$$z^+_t + z^-_t \leq 1 \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$

where $SOC_t$ is the battery state of charge at time $t$, $\eta^+$ and $\eta^-$ are charging and discharging efficiencies, $z^+_t$ and $z^-_t$ are binary variables indicating charging and discharging states.

**Grid Constraints:**

$$g^+_t = \sum_{d \in D} c_{d,t} \cdot x_{d,t} + b^+_t - b^-_t - s_t \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$
$$0 \leq g^+_t \leq G_{\max} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$
$$0 \leq g^-_t \leq G_{\max}^{-} \quad \forall t \in \{0,1,\ldots,T-1\}$$

where $g^+_t$ is the power imported from the grid at time $t$, $g^-_t$ is the power exported to the grid, and $G_{\max}$ and $G_{\max}^{-}$ are the maximum import and export capacities.

#### B.2. Probability Model Update Equations

The probability update mechanism follows a Bayesian-inspired approach:

$$P_{d,t}^{\text{new}} = P_{d,t}^{\text{old}} + \alpha \cdot (L_{d,t} - P_{d,t}^{\text{old}})$$

where $P_{d,t}^{\text{old}}$ is the prior probability, $L_{d,t}$ is the likelihood (1 if device was used, 0 otherwise), and $\alpha$ is the adaptive learning rate given by:

$$\alpha = \max\left(\alpha_{\min}, \min\left(\alpha_{\max}, \alpha_0 \cdot \gamma^n\right)\right)$$

where $\alpha_0$ is the initial learning rate, $\gamma$ is the decay factor, $n$ is the number of updates, and $\alpha_{\min}$ and $\alpha_{\max}$ are the minimum and maximum learning rates.

For unexpected usage patterns (usage at times with low probability):

$$\alpha = \min\left(\alpha_{\max}, \alpha_0 \cdot \gamma^n \cdot 2\right)$$

#### C.3. Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of key parameters on system performance:

1. **Learning Rate Impact**: Varying the learning rate between 0.05 and 0.3 showed that higher learning rates led to faster convergence but potentially less stable probability distributions. The optimal range was found to be 0.1-0.15.

2. **Price Forecast Error**: The system maintained 80% of its cost savings even with price forecast errors of up to 20%.

3. **User Preference Weight**: For every 0.1 increase in user preference weight, cost savings decreased by approximately 2-3%.

4. **Battery Capacity**: Doubling battery capacity from 5kWh to 10kWh increased cost savings by 7-9% for buildings with PV systems.
