# Advanced Energy Management System (EMS) Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This technical report presents a comprehensive Energy Management System (EMS) designed to optimize the operation of flexible energy devices, batteries, and PV systems in residential and commercial buildings. Building upon established MILP-based energy management frameworks (such as those by Antunes et al., 2022; Bradac et al., 2014; Gerards et al., 2015), our system advances the field by integrating probabilistic modeling of device usage patterns with robust-to-uncertainty mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization techniques.

The system addresses the pressing need for automated energy management in both advanced markets with dynamic pricing (like the Netherlands) and emerging markets (like Curaçao) by integrating machine learning with traditional optimization methods. By learning user behavior patterns and device operational characteristics, the EMS creates personalized schedules that minimize energy costs while maintaining user comfort and respecting system constraints.

Building on the foundation of existing research, our system contributes the following advancements:

1. **Enhanced probabilistic approach to device usage modeling** using gradient-boosted tree models (LightGBM for daily usage prediction, CatBoost for hourly patterns)
2. **Tighter integration of learned probability mass functions (PMFs)** as soft constraints in MILP formulations
3. **Improved handling of PV generation and Electric Vehicle operation uncertainties**
4. **Implementation of a closed feedback loop** that continuously improves device models through Bayesian updates
5. **Comprehensive MLflow integration** for model versioning, tracking, and deployment for both prediction models and optimization models

The results demonstrate consistent cost savings between 10-30% compared to unoptimized operation, increased self-consumption of on-site PV generation, and effective battery value realization through price arbitrage.

## 2. Project Context

### 2.1 Background and Motivation

The modern energy landscape is undergoing rapid transformation driven by increased renewable energy integration, dynamic electricity pricing, and rising consumption complexity. In advanced smart grids—such as those emerging in the Netherlands—electricity prices fluctuate frequently, offering substantial opportunities for cost optimization through demand response and load shifting. However, many buildings lack automated energy management capabilities, leaving households and commercial users unable to fully exploit potential cost savings.

Simultaneously, as renewable energy sources like solar and wind become prevalent, grid stability challenges emerge due to intermittent generation patterns. This intermittency increases grid congestion risks, particularly during peak periods, and necessitates more sophisticated demand-side management strategies to ensure reliability.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Against the backdrop of transforming energy landscapes, our project aims to bridge the efficiency gap between current consumption patterns and the potential for flexible, optimized energy use. The central research problem is framed as:

"How can we design a modular, AI-enabled EMS that leverages MILP-based scheduling to optimize household energy consumption under dynamic pricing—integrating optional DERs (PV, battery) and grid constraints—in a way that is immediately effective in the Dutch context and readily adaptable for the evolving Curaçao market?"

We identified that the "energy efficiency gap"—where households consume energy inefficiently due to behavioral inertia and a lack of automated control—has received considerable attention in the literature. Several notable studies, such as Henggeler Antunes et al. (2022), Bradac et al. (2014), and Gerards et al. (2015), have developed modular and holistic MILP-based optimization frameworks that can accommodate a range of flexible and inflexible devices within residential or commercial buildings.

### 2.3 Dual-Track Approach

This project employs a **dual-track approach**:
1. **Dutch Context**: Prototyped in an environment with day-ahead pricing, smart metering, and flexible demand-response capabilities
2. **Curaçao Context**: Designed for future adaptation to Caribbean island settings where current pricing is monthly and smart infrastructure is still developing

In advanced smart grids like those emerging in the Netherlands, day-ahead electricity pricing offers substantial opportunities for automated load shifting and cost reduction. However, many existing residential and commercial buildings lack automated energy management systems to optimize usage effectively.

### 2.4 Stakeholder Value Proposition

#### For Utilities and Grid Operators
The EMS can facilitate peak shaving through adherence to day-ahead prices and reduce grid congestion, easing the burden on the local grid.

#### For End-Users
It offers cost savings by automatically shifting energy use to cheaper periods and helps prevent energy poverty by maintaining consumption within affordable limits.

#### For Ilustre Lab and Partners
It serves as a testbed for AI-driven energy optimization, forming a foundational platform that can be extended to other domains and deployed in diverse environments.

### 2.5 Literature Context

The development of our Energy Management System builds upon several key research areas, including home energy management systems (HEMS), probabilistic optimization under uncertainty, and machine learning for energy usage prediction.

Among various approaches in the literature, Antunes et al. (2022) explored probabilistic and scenario-based optimization for home energy management under user behavior uncertainty. Their approach of modeling user behavior as probability distributions rather than deterministic patterns provided useful insights for our methodology. However, their system relied on pre-defined distributions rather than learning them from historical data.

Building on this foundation, our system contributes advancements in:
1. Enhanced integration of learned behavior patterns through machine learning
2. Tighter probabilistic-MILP integration within unified frameworks
3. Adaptive continuous learning through closed-loop feedback mechanisms
4. Cross-market adaptability for diverse pricing environments
