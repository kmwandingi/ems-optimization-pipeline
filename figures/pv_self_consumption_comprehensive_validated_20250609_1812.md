# PV Self-Consumption Analysis - Complete Dataset Validation

## Methodology

### Self-Consumption Calculation
PV self-consumption measures the percentage of generated solar energy used on-site:

```
Self-Consumption = (Σ min(Generation[t], Consumption[t])) / (Σ Generation[t]) × 100
```

Where:
- Generation[t] = PV output at time t (negative values converted to positive)
- Consumption[t] = Total building consumption at time t
- Calculation performed for all 8,760+ hourly timesteps per building

## Data Validation
