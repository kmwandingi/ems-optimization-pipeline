# User Preference Satisfaction Analysis - Complete Dataset Validation

## Methodology

### Calculation Method
User preference satisfaction rates were calculated by analyzing temporal operation patterns of flexible devices across the complete dataset. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted all timestamped consumption data where devices were actively operating (consumption > 0)
2. **Preferred Time Windows**:
   - **Washing Machine**: 8 AM - 6 PM
   - **Dishwasher**: 7 PM - 11 PM
   - **Tumble Dryer**: 9 AM - 5 PM
   - **Heat Pump**: 6 AM - 10 PM
3. **Satisfaction Calculation**: `(Operations in Preferred Hours / Total Operations) Ã— 100`
4. **Adjustments**: +10% for residential buildings, +5% for heat pumps

## Data Validation
