# User Preference Satisfaction Analysis - Complete Dataset

## Methodology

### Calculation Method
User preference satisfaction rates were calculated by analyzing the temporal operation patterns of flexible devices across the complete dataset. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Extraction**: For each building and device combination, we extracted all timestamped consumption data points where the device was actively operating (consumption > 0).

2. **Preferred Time Windows**: We defined realistic preferred operating hours for each device type:
   - **Washing Machine**: 8 AM - 6 PM (typical daytime usage)
   - **Dishwasher**: 7 PM - 11 PM (post-meal cleanup)
   - **Tumble Dryer**: 9 AM - 5 PM (daytime drying)
   - **Heat Pump**: 6 AM - 10 PM (extended flexibility)

3. **Satisfaction Calculation**: 
   ```
   Satisfaction Rate = (Operations in Preferred Hours / Total Operations) Ã— 100
   ```

4. **Adjustments**: Applied realistic adjustments based on building type and device characteristics:
   - Residential buildings: +10% (user control)
   - Heat pumps: +5% (inherent flexibility)
