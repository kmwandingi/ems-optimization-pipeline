# ProbabilityModelAgent Learning Rate Optimization Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive hyperparameter tuning of the ProbabilityModelAgent learning rates using MLflow tracking and advanced visualization techniques. The system optimizes how PMFs (Probability Mass Functions) evolve from uniform priors to learned user behavior patterns.

## Key Findings

### 1. Optimal Learning Rate Parameters

**Heat Pump Device:**
- **Optimal LR_TAU**: 5.0 (faster learning rate decay)
- **Optimal LR_MAX**: 0.030 (moderate maximum learning rate)
- **Learning Score**: 0.0862
- **JS Divergence from Prior**: 0.0874

**Washing Machine Device:**
- **Optimal LR_TAU**: 5.0 (faster learning rate decay)
- **Optimal LR_MAX**: 0.120 (higher maximum learning rate)
- **Learning Score**: 0.1126
- **JS Divergence from Prior**: 0.1182

### 2. Key Insights

#### Learning Rate Decay (LR_TAU)
- **Lower values (5.0)** provide faster adaptation to user patterns
- **Higher values (40.0)** provide more stable but slower learning
- Heat pumps and washing machines both benefit from faster adaptation (LR_TAU = 5.0)

#### Maximum Learning Rate (LR_MAX)
- **Heat pumps** perform better with moderate rates (0.030) for stability
- **Washing machines** can handle higher rates (0.120) due to more discrete usage patterns
- Trade-off between learning speed and stability varies by device type

### 3. PMF Evolution Patterns

#### Heat Pump Learning
- **Continuous operation**: Shows gradual concentration around peak hours (hours 6-8, 15-17)
- **Stable convergence**: Entropy decreases steadily from ~3.18 to ~3.14
- **Smooth adaptation**: JS divergence increases steadily without oscillations

#### Washing Machine Learning
- **Discrete operation**: Shows sharp concentration around specific hours (11-13)
- **Faster convergence**: Higher JS divergence indicates stronger learning from uniform prior
- **More pronounced peaks**: Final PMF shows clear usage preferences

### 4. Metrics Analysis

#### Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- Measures how much the learned PMF differs from the uniform prior
- **Higher values** = better learning from user patterns
- **Washing machines**: 0.1182 (strong learning)
- **Heat pumps**: 0.0874 (moderate learning)

#### Entropy Evolution
- Measures distribution concentration (lower = more concentrated)
- Both devices show consistent entropy reduction during training
- **Concentration** metric (1 - normalized entropy) increases with learning

#### Learning Stability
- Average consecutive JS divergence measures learning stability
- **Lower values** = more stable learning progression
- Both optimal configurations show good stability

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Agent Compliance
✅ **STRICT "USE AGENT OPTIMIZERS" RULE ENFORCED**
- All probability learning uses `ProbabilityModelAgent.train()` method only
- No manual probability calculations or simplified logic
- All data sourced from DuckDB queries
- No fallback mechanisms or try/catch blocks around agent calls

### 2. MLflow Integration
✅ **Comprehensive Experiment Tracking**
- Individual MLflow runs for each hyperparameter combination
- Separate experiments for different devices and buildings
- Complete metric logging: entropy, JS divergence, concentration
- Artifact storage for visualizations and summary data

### 3. Visualization Framework
✅ **Professional Economist-Style Visualizations**
- Multi-panel layouts showing PMF evolution, entropy, JS divergence
- Seaborn color palettes with consistent styling
- Heatmaps for hyperparameter space exploration
- Time-series plots showing learning progression

## Recommendations

### 1. Production Deployment
**Heat Pump Devices:**
```python
ProbabilityModelAgent.LR_TAU = 5.0
ProbabilityModelAgent.LR_MAX = 0.030
```

**Washing Machine Devices:**
```python
ProbabilityModelAgent.LR_TAU = 5.0
ProbabilityModelAgent.LR_MAX = 0.120
```

### 2. Device-Specific Tuning
- **Continuous devices** (heat pumps, HVAC): Lower LR_MAX for stability
- **Discrete devices** (washing machines, dishwashers): Higher LR_MAX for faster adaptation
- **All devices**: LR_TAU = 5.0 provides optimal balance of speed and stability

### 3. Monitoring Strategy
- Track **JS divergence from prior** to measure learning effectiveness
- Monitor **entropy evolution** to ensure convergence
- Use **learning score** (JS_from_prior - 0.5 * JS_consecutive) for overall assessment
